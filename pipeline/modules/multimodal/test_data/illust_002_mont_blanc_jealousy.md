しかし、仕方がないので私は歩き始めた。
この辺りは来たことがなかった。普段見ない景色が物珍しく、辺りを見渡していた。
"海以君が一緒だったら、もっと楽しかったのでしょうか"
思わずそんなことを考えてしまう。彼がここに居たら、色々案内してくれたのかな、とか。ううん。きっと、ただ隣に居てくれるだけでも安心して、楽しくなると思う。
でも、隣に彼は居ない。それを考えるだけで胸にチクリと針が刺さったような痛みが走る。
一度、口を引き結んでから私は歩き始めた。
すると、一つのお店が目に留まった。一見それはカフェのように見えた。しかし、少し違う。よく見れば、それはスイーツの専門店のようだった。
外に立てられている旗を見たところ、モンブランのフェアが今日までやっているらしい。私は思わず考えてしまった。
"…海以君と行きたかったですね"
そう呟いてしまい、すぐに首を振った。ここは彼の高校が近い。彼と一緒に食べていたら変に思われてしまうかもしれない。ただでさえ最近は海以君のことが周りにバレかけているのだ。彼に迷惑を掛けたくない。
そろそろ戻ろうかな、と思った時。

私は見てしまった。
"──海以君"
彼が、綺麗な女性と楽しそうに──モンブランのパフェを食べているところを。

栗色の髪にふんわりとパーマが掛かっている。とても明るそうな女性と。
ああ。ここ、だったんだ。彼が言っていた場所は。
ギュッと。まるで、心が絞られたみたいに痛くなった。

"I wonder if it would have been more fun if Minori-kun were with me."

I found myself thinking such things. If he were here, would he have shown me around? No… I'm sure just having him by my side would have been reassuring and fun.

But he wasn't by my side. Just thinking about that sent a sharp pain through my chest, like being pricked by a needle.

I pursed my lips once and started walking.

Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café. But it was slightly different. Looking closely, it seemed to be a dessert specialty shop.

According to the flag outside, they were having a Mont Blanc special that ended today. I couldn't help but think.

"…I wanted to go with Minori-kun."

I muttered, then quickly shook my head. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, it might seem strange. Lately, people were already starting to figure things out about Minori-kun and me. I didn't want to cause him trouble.

Just as I was thinking about heading back…

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

I saw it.

"—Minori-kun."

He was… with a beautiful woman, laughing and enjoying—a Mont Blanc parfait.

A woman with soft, wavy, chestnut-colored hair who looked very cheerful.

Ah. So this was the place he was talking about.

*Squeeze*. My heart ached as if it were being wrung out.

## 3. 🎨 Multimodal Translation

With no other choice, I began to walk.

I had never visited this area before. The scenery was unfamiliar, a novelty that kept me gazing around as I made my way down the street.

*If Souta were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*

The thought crossed my mind before I could stop it. If he were here, maybe he would show me around. No... I am sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy.

But he wasn't by my side. The mere thought sent a prick of pain through my chest, as if a needle had struck my heart.

I pursed my lips tight, then began walking again.

Then, a particular shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop. According to the flag fluttering outside, there was a Mont Blanc fair running until today.

I couldn't help but think it.

"...I wish I could have gone with Souta."

I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, people might get the wrong idea. Rumors about us were already starting to circulate, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble.

Just as I was thinking it was time to head back...

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

I saw it.

*—Souta.*

There he was, looking so happy as he ate a Mont Blanc parfait... with a beautiful woman.

She had chestnut hair styled in a soft, airy perm, and she looked like a very cheerful person.

Ah. So this was it. The place he had mentioned.

*Squeeze.*

My chest tightened. It hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry.

## 4. 🧠 Thought Process

### Iteration 1

```
**Translation and Emotional Processing**

Okay, here's how I'd approach this translation, reflecting on the narrative flow and emotional core. First, the text. I see that the user is interested in a Japanese-to-English translation of a light novel excerpt. The core of this excerpt seems to be a moment of jealousy, or heartache for the character Nagi. This is an excellent opportunity to showcase how the original text crafts this emotional tension.

My first step is always to **analyze the source text**. I'm looking for the emotional pulse of the scene. Nagi's walking alone, unfamiliar territory. She is thinking of Souta, wishing he were with her. There's a sweets shop, the kind of place they might enjoy together... but it's near his school, which introduces a layer of restraint because of potential gossip. The climax hits: she sees him *inside* with another woman, and there is a vivid description of her. The emotional beat is, unmistakably, jealousy. The "squeezed heart" is the key.

Then, I'm identifying the **markers**. The illustration tag `[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]` is a crucial detail. I need to know what that image depicts. I'll need to call `get_illustration` immediately for "illust-002" to understand the visual context. This will influence how I render the scene. Is it Nagi's shocked perspective? Does the image highlight Souta and the other woman's happiness? The visual element is part of the scene.

Now, into the **drafting the translation (mental or scratchpad)** phase. I go through each sentence, with a focus on capturing the nuance:

*   "But, having no other choice, I started walking." I'm starting with this flow, avoiding a direct literal translation.
*   "I had never been in this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty, and I found myself gazing around." This isn't just about the scenery; it sets the stage for her feelings.
*   "Would this be more fun if Souta-kun were with me?" Note the subtle formality.
*   "I couldn't help but wonder. If he were here, would he have shown me around?" (or "introduced me to this place?") The wistfulness is important.
*   "No. I’m sure just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy." Short, to the point.
*   "But he wasn't there. The mere thought sent a prick of pain through my chest, as if a needle had struck my heart." That image – the "needle prick" – will have to be rendered artfully.
*   "I pursed my lips tight, then began walking again." That's not just a physical action, it reveals her resolve.
*   "Then, a particular shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café." The observation is a key part of the setup.
*   "But it was slightly different. Looking closer, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop." Setting a more descriptive tone.
*   "According to the flag fluttering outside, there was a Mont Blanc fair running until today." I'm ensuring the "Mont Blanc" is clear. I will look for any more established translation in the image description.
*   "The thought crossed my mind before I could stop it."
*   "*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*" (This is her internal thought, keeping the polite, slightly reserved tone.)
*   "I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head." The moment's passed, and she's trying to get control.
*   "His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, people might get the wrong idea."
*   "Rumors about us were already starting to circulate. I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
*   "Just as I was thinking it was time to head back..."

*   (Now the illustration marker.)

*   "I saw it." The short, blunt statement. This makes it impactful.
*   "*—Souta-kun.*" The shift from thought to recognition.
*   "There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait... with a beautiful woman." The visual details need to be there for impact.
*   "She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. She looked like a very cheerful person."
*   "Ah. So this was it. The place he had mentioned."
*   "My chest tightened. It hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry." The final, devastating blow.

This is where the image becomes extremely important. The `get_illustration` call is necessary. It guides

### Iteration 2

**The Sudden Truth**

Okay, so I was lost in my own thoughts, a little wistful, a little hopeful, maybe… I don’t know. Then I saw it. The illustration is a two-panel split, and it hit me like a physical blow.

*Souta.* There he was, in the top panel, sitting at a table. He looked completely relaxed, holding a spoon, as though he hadn't a care in the world. And next to him… a woman. Chestnut hair, styled in a soft perm, and a smile so bright it almost hurt to look at. They were clearly enjoying themselves, glasses – probably the parfait he mentioned – between them. She was radiant.

My gaze dropped to the bottom panel. *Squeeze.* My chest… it tightened so painfully. My grip on my bag strap was almost unbearable, mirroring the feeling in my heart. My eyes widened, the world seemed to tilt. My lips, which I had pursed just moments ago, were now a thin, stunned line. This… this was the place he had been talking about, wasn't it? The place where he was happily eating that Mont Blanc parfait with *her*. Ah. So this was it. It's really happening.
