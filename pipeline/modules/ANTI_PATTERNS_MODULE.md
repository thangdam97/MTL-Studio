## PART 1: ANTI-FORMAL LANGUAGE

### Core Principle: MATCH REGISTER TO CHARACTER AGE

**Bad:** "I shall accompany you to the establishment to procure sustenance."
**Good:** "Wanna grab food?"

### 1.1 Formal Vocabulary → Casual Register

**Rule:** Prefer simple verbs (go, get, make) over Latinate forms (depart, procure, commence) for casual speech.

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use Instead |
|---------|---------------|
| "Shall we depart?" | "Wanna go?" / "Let's go." |
| "I must commence studying." | "I gotta start studying." |
| "I shall accompany you." | "I'll come with you." |
| "Let us convene at the library." | "Let's meet at the library." |
| "I wish to inquire about..." | "Can I ask about..." |

**Register Table:**
| Formal (Avoid) | Casual (Use) |
|---------------|--------------|
| depart | head out, bail |
| procure | grab, pick up |
| commence | kick off, start |
| inquire | ask, check |
| accompany | come along, tag along |
| converse | chat |
| consume | grab a bite |

### 1.2 Modal Verbs and Contractions

**Rule:**
- **ALWAYS contract** in casual dialogue: I'm, you're, can't, won't
- **AVOID "shall"** unless Ojou-sama archetype (<40% frequency)
- **AVOID "ought"** entirely (archaic)

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use |
|---------|-------|
| "I shall do it." | "I'll do it." |
| "We ought to leave." | "We should leave." / "We gotta go." |
| "I cannot do that." | "I can't do that." |
| "Do you not agree?" | "Don't you think?" / "Right?" |

**Exception:** Emphasis/anger = "I will NOT!" (uncontracted for stress)

### 1.3 Request Phrasings

**Rule:** Friends don't talk like customer service scripts.

| ❌ Over-Formal | ✅ Casual |
|---------------|----------|
| "Would you be so kind as to..." | "Can you..." / "Could you..." |
| "I would appreciate it if you could..." | "Can you please..." |
| "May I request that you..." | "Can I ask you to..." |
| "It would be advisable to..." | "You should..." / "You might wanna..." |

### 1.4 Adjectives and Adverbs

**Pattern:** Using "sophisticated" vocabulary when simple words suffice.

| ❌ Formal | ✅ Natural |
|----------|-----------|
| "immensely" | "really" / "super" |
| "exceedingly" | "really" / "way" |
| "rather" (British hedge) | "pretty" / "kinda" |
| "quite" (British) | "pretty" / "really" |
| "considerably" | "a lot" / "way more" |
| "particularly" | "really" / "especially" |

**Teen Intensifiers:** super, really, so, way, hella (regional), mad (slang), crazy

## PART 2: ANTI-EXPOSITION DUMP

### Core Principle: SHOW, DON'T TELL

**Bad:** "She was angry because he forgot. This made her feel betrayed."
**Good:** "She turned away, fists clenched. 'You forgot.'"

### 2.1 Emotion Exposition → Physical Reactions

**Rule:** Replace "felt/was [emotion]" with observable actions.

| ❌ Telling | ✅ Showing |
|-----------|-----------|
| She felt nervous. | She tapped her foot, checking her phone every few seconds. |
| He was angry. | His jaw tightened. "Is that so?" |
| I felt relieved. | My shoulders dropped. "Thank god." |
| She seemed happy. | A smile broke across her face. "Really?!" |

**Show Through:**
- Physical reactions: blushing, trembling, shoulders drooping
- Facial expressions: furrowed brow, tight smile
- Vocal cues: voice cracking, laughing
- Actions: slamming door, looking away

**Exception (1st person POV):** Use sensory descriptions
- ❌ "I felt anxious."
- ✅ "My stomach twisted into knots."

### 2.2 Motivation Exposition → Context Clues

**Rule:** Let readers connect dots. Don't explain "because."

| ❌ Exposition | ✅ Implied |
|--------------|-----------|
| She avoided eye contact because she was hiding something. | She avoided eye contact, fingers twisting together. |
| He bought snacks because he wanted to apologize. | He showed up with her favorite snacks, head ducked. "Can we talk?" |
| I studied because I wanted to impress her. | I stayed up until 3 AM reviewing notes. Tomorrow's test—she'd be there. |

**Provide:** Actions + Context + Reactions → Reader infers motivation

### 2.3 Meta-Commentary → In-Character Perspective

**Rule:** NO narrator explaining character psychology.

| ❌ Meta-Commentary | ✅ Show Through Behavior |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| She was the type who always put others first. | She glanced at her untouched lunch, then at her friend's empty plate. "Want half?" |
| His tsundere personality made it hard to express feelings. | "I-It's not like I made this for you! I just had extras..." |
| Deep down, she was jealous. | "I'm happy for you," she said, voice a bit too bright. |
| This was a defense mechanism from trauma. | He flinched when she raised her hand—just to fix his hair. |

### 2.4 Relationship Exposition → Behavioral Patterns

**Rule:** Show relationships through recurring interactions.

| ❌ Telling | ✅ Showing |
|-----------|-----------|
| They were close childhood friends. | "Oi, idiot." She flicked his forehead like she'd done since elementary school. |
| He had a crush on her but was too shy. | He looked away the moment she smiled. His ears were definitely red. |
| She secretly admired him. | Her gaze lingered on him when he wasn't looking. |

## PART 3: COMBINED ANTI-PATTERNS CHECKLIST

### Formal Language Red Flags
- [ ] "Shall" in casual teen dialogue (unless Ojou archetype)
- [ ] Uncontracted modals: "I am", "I will", "cannot"
- [ ] Latinate verbs: depart, procure, commence, inquire
- [ ] British hedges: rather, quite, exceedingly
- [ ] Business phrasings: "Would you be so kind as to..."

### Exposition Dump Red Flags
- [ ] "felt [emotion]" / "was [emotion]"
- [ ] "because [motivation]" explanations
- [ ] "She was the type who..." psychology analysis
- [ ] "This made her feel..." cause-effect exposition
- [ ] "Deep down, he..." internal state narration (3rd person)

### Quick Fix Guide
| If you see... | Replace with... |
|--------------|----------------|
| "She felt sad." | Physical cue: tears, slumped shoulders, quiet voice |
| "He did X because Y." | Show X, imply Y through context |
| "I shall depart." | "I'll go." / "I'm heading out." |
| "Rather interesting." | "Pretty cool." / "Kinda interesting." |
| "She was the type..." | Show pattern through repeated behavior |

## PART 4: ARCHETYPE EXCEPTIONS

### When Formal Language IS Appropriate

**Ojou-sama Characters:**
- Can use "shall" at 30-40% frequency (not 100%)
- Still contract: "I'm", "you're", "can't" (NOT "I am")
- "Ought" permitted but rare

**Elderly Characters:**
- Slightly formal register acceptable
- Still use contractions in casual contexts
- "Ought" acceptable, "shall" rare

**Fantasy Nobility:**
- Formal register in court/public
- Casual register in private moments
- Context-dependent formality

### When Exposition IS Necessary

**Complex Plot Points:**
- Use dialogue to explain (character teaching another)
- NOT narrator meta-commentary

**First-Person Unreliable Narrator:**
- Can self-analyze (but make it character voice)
- ✅ "I told myself I didn't care. (Spoiler: I cared.)"
- ❌ "I was using sarcasm as a coping mechanism."
