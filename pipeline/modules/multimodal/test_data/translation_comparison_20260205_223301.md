## Scene 1: First Train Meeting - Good Morning
**Illustration:** `illust-001`

### 1. 📖 Japanese Source

```
ガタンゴトン、ガタンゴトン。
次の日。電車に揺られながら、俺はスマートフォンを弄っていた。今日は運良く乗ったタイミングで席が空き、周りを見ても誰も座る様子がなかったので座ったのだ。もちろん常識はあるので、席が必要な人が居れば譲るつもりだ。
次の駅に着くと、隣のサラリーマンが降りるために立ち上がった。それと同時に、隣に女子高生らしい人影が座り──席が必要な人が居ないか見渡そうとした時だった。

"おはようございます"

隣からそう声を掛けられ、心臓が止まるかと思った。
頭をそちらに向けようとしたのだが、ギギ、と錆びた機械のような音が鳴りそうだった。

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-001.jpg]

まず最初に目に付いたのは、蒼い瞳。海のように蒼く、どこまでも深く吸い込まれそうな瞳だ。
続いて目に入ったのは、新雪のように真っ白な髪と肌。もちろん髪の方が白いのだが、肌もミルクのように白く、無垢な子どもを連想させる。その白さは決して病的なものではなく、例えるのならば飴細工のような繊細さと透明感を放っていた。
そして、キリッとした顔立ちは凜々しいものがある。その表情は普段からほとんど変わらない。美しくも、可愛くも思える。
"…あの"
彼女の柔らかい鈴を転がすような声音に俺は意識を取り戻した。
まずい、見蕩れていた。

### 2. 📚 Reference EN (Expected)

The next day, as the train swayed, I was fiddling with my smartphone. I'd gotten lucky and found an empty seat right when I boarded, and since no one else seemed to need it, I sat down. Of course, I'm not a total jerk, so I was fully prepared to give it up if someone who needed it came along.

When we reached the next station, the salaryman next to me stood up to get off. At the same time, the silhouette of a high school girl sat down beside me—and just as I was about to look around for anyone who might need the seat…

"Good morning."

A voice from beside me made my heart nearly stop.

I tried to turn my head toward her, but it felt like it would creak like a rusty machine.

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-001.jpg]

The first thing I saw were her blue eyes. As blue as the ocean, so deep you felt like you could be drawn into them forever.

Next came her snow-white hair and skin. Her hair was whiter, of course, but her skin was as pale as milk, reminding me of an innocent child. The whiteness wasn't sickly at all; if anything, it had the delicate, transparent quality of spun sugar.

And her sharp, chiseled features gave her a dignified air. Her expression was, as usual, almost unchanging. She could be seen as beautiful, or as cute.

"…Excuse me."

Her soft, bell-like voice brought me back to my senses.

Damn, I'd been staring.

### 3. 🎨 Multimodal Translation

*Clackety-clack, clackety-clack.*

The rhythmic swaying of the train car rocked me back and forth.

It was the following day. I sat there, idly scrolling through my smartphone. By a stroke of luck, a seat had opened up right as I boarded, and since no one else seemed to want it, I took the spot. I had common sense, of course; if I saw someone who actually needed the seat, I intended to give it up immediately.

When we arrived at the next station, the salaryman beside me stood up to get off. Almost simultaneously, a figure—looking like a high school girl—slid into the empty space. Just as I was about to glance around to check if there were any elderly or priority passengers nearby, a voice spoke.

"Good morning."

The greeting came from right beside me. My heart nearly stopped.

I tried to turn my head toward the source of the voice, but my neck moved stiffly, feeling as if it were emitting the grinding screech of a rusted machine.

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-001.jpg]

The first things that caught my eye were her blue irises. They were as blue as the ocean—deep, endless pools that threatened to pull me in.

Next, I noticed her hair and skin, both as white as fresh snow. Her hair was naturally the whiter of the two, but her skin was milk-pale, evoking the innocence of a child. Yet, this whiteness wasn't sickly; if I had to use a metaphor, it possessed the delicate transparency of fine spun-sugar candy.

Her features were sharp and dignified. It was the kind of face that rarely showed much emotion. She looked beautiful, yet at the same time, undeniably cute.

"...Um."

Her voice, soft and clear like the chiming of a small bell, snapped me back to reality.

*Crap.* I had been completely mesmerized.

**My Approach to the Light Novel Translation**

Okay, so I've got a Japanese light novel excerpt to translate. The user wants a fulsome rendering of my thought process, which, as an expert in my field, I can certainly provide. Let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the scene. It's the next day, and the protagonist, Souta, is on a train, absorbed in his smartphone. The setting needs to be established; the sounds, the atmosphere. Then, someone sits next to him. A simple "Good morning," *おはようございます*, a formal greeting. Easy enough.

But then, the reaction! Souta is startled, "heart almost stopped," and his movement is described with this interesting simile, "like a rusted machine." That needs to be captured; the suddenness, the awkwardness.

Now comes the crucial part: the illustration tag, `[ILLUSTRATION: illust-001.jpg]`. This is where I need to be precise. The description *after* the tag is what I'll build on, but I need to see the visual first. My immediate action is to call `get_illustration`. I need to see her expression and appearance in *illust-001* to match the text's description perfectly. Does she look shy, bored, or genuinely friendly? That visual input is critical.

The text *post*-illustration offers this description. Blue eyes, like the deep sea. White hair and skin, like fresh snow or milk. This isn't a sickly white; it's delicate, like *amezaiku*, that beautiful candy art. Sharp, dignified features, and her expression is barely changing. She's beautiful and cute. But how does that "barely changing" expression look? I'll need to know it to render it well.

Then, there's her soft voice, like a bell, saying “…Um.” *…あの*. I want to make sure the tone of her voice is in the translation.

Finally, Souta realizes he's been staring. That internal monologue needs to convey his stunned surprise. It's a quick sequence, but the details in this situation can inform my work.

So, the strategy is this: set the scene, handle the unexpected greeting, and then translate the description *integrating* the visual from `illust-001`. I need that illustration to create the strongest translation. And finally, the quick internal reflection. I'm ready to begin the translation, but only after I see `illust-001`.



```

#### Iteration 3

```
**My Initial Impressions: A Visual and Linguistic Breakdown**

Alright, let's break this down. First, the visual: that illustration. I'm seeing a girl with long, light-colored hair, seated on a train. Her expression is key here – that reserved, slightly stoic, yet dignified air. The hair clip is important; it subtly links her to the "snow" motifs in the text. School uniform, ribbon… it all suggests a certain quiet elegance. This needs to be carefully conveyed.

Now, the translation. I want this to flow smoothly, but also capture that initial impact. The "clack-clack" of the train – that onomatopoeia is essential for setting the scene. I like "Click-clack, click-clack" or "Clackety-clack, clackety-clack." It immediately puts the reader on the train with Souta.

The neighbor leaves, she sits. The voice needs to be polite, but also a bit sudden. The "Good morning" needs to be crisp. That reaction… "Heart almost stopped." The rusted machine metaphor is great; I need to convey the sudden, almost mechanical turn of his head. This is great, this needs to be worked through.

Then, that crucial moment, the visual description. The blue eyes, "like the sea." That's vivid, that's what I want. They are clearly the focal point. That "white hair and skin, like fresh snow, like candy art." *Amezaiku* is so specific. I’ll keep the idea of candy craftsmanship. "Spun sugar," "glasswork," they hint at that delicacy and translucent quality. But it needs to be *described* as "delicate candy craftsmanship." That “dignified” expression – the image and the text are perfectly aligned here.

I need to nail this dialogue. "…Um." (あの) – she notices him staring, and this needs to be conveyed. A simple, almost hesitant acknowledgment.

Finally, the closing thought: realizing he was mesmerized. This is about capturing the visual and emotional impact.

Regarding the specific phrases. I like "fiddling with my smartphone" over "ijitteita" for a more contemporary feel. "Luckily" is a safe choice, "By a stroke of luck" adds a bit more drama. I will stick to the "Like the grinding gears of a rusted machine" description. For the sound, I'm leaning toward "Like the chiming of a bell" – a clear, pleasant sound to contrast with the machine.

## Scene 2: Mont Blanc Jealousy
**Illustration:** `illust-002`

### 1. 📖 Japanese Source

```
しかし、仕方がないので私は歩き始めた。
この辺りは来たことがなかった。普段見ない景色が物珍しく、辺りを見渡していた。
"海以君が一緒だったら、もっと楽しかったのでしょうか"
思わずそんなことを考えてしまう。彼がここに居たら、色々案内してくれたのかな、とか。ううん。きっと、ただ隣に居てくれるだけでも安心して、楽しくなると思う。
でも、隣に彼は居ない。それを考えるだけで胸にチクリと針が刺さったような痛みが走る。
一度、口を引き結んでから私は歩き始めた。
すると、一つのお店が目に留まった。一見それはカフェのように見えた。しかし、少し違う。よく見れば、それはスイーツの専門店のようだった。
外に立てられている旗を見たところ、モンブランのフェアが今日までやっているらしい。私は思わず考えてしまった。
"…海以君と行きたかったですね"
そう呟いてしまい、すぐに首を振った。ここは彼の高校が近い。彼と一緒に食べていたら変に思われてしまうかもしれない。ただでさえ最近は海以君のことが周りにバレかけているのだ。彼に迷惑を掛けたくない。
そろそろ戻ろうかな、と思った時。

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

私は見てしまった。
"──海以君"
彼が、綺麗な女性と楽しそうに──モンブランのパフェを食べているところを。

栗色の髪にふんわりとパーマが掛かっている。とても明るそうな女性と。
ああ。ここ、だったんだ。彼が言っていた場所は。
ギュッと。まるで、心が絞られたみたいに痛くなった。
```

### 2. 📚 Reference EN (Expected)

But he wasn't by my side. Just thinking about that sent a sharp pain through my chest, like being pricked by a needle.

I pursed my lips once and started walking.

Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café. But it was slightly different. Looking closely, it seemed to be a dessert specialty shop.

According to the flag outside, they were having a Mont Blanc special that ended today. I couldn't help but think.

"…I wanted to go with Minori-kun."

I muttered, then quickly shook my head. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, it might seem strange. Lately, people were already starting to figure things out about Minori-kun and me. I didn't want to cause him trouble.

Just as I was thinking about heading back…

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

I saw it.

"—Minori-kun."

He was… with a beautiful woman, laughing and enjoying—a Mont Blanc parfait.

A woman with soft, wavy, chestnut-colored hair who looked very cheerful.

Ah. So this was the place he was talking about.

*Squeeze*. My heart ached as if it were being wrung out.

### 3. 🎨 Multimodal Translation

7 thought
The illustration shows a split composition.
Top half: Souta (dark hair, school uniform) is sitting at a table across from a girl with long wavy hair. They have parfait glasses in front of them. Souta is holding a spoon, looking at the girl. The girl is smiling brightly.
Bottom half: Nagi (light hair, ribbon, uniform) is looking at them with a shocked, hurt expression. Her eyes are wide, slightly blank, conveying the "heart squeezed" feeling.

This confirms the scene description. Nagi is witnessing Souta on a "date" (or what looks like one). The woman has wavy hair as described.

Translation adjustments based on visual:
- Nagi's expression is one of shock and sudden heartbreak. The prose should reflect that frozen moment.
- The top scene is cheerful, contrasting with Nagi's isolation.
- The "Chestnut hair" description matches the girl in the top panel (though black and white, the tone suggests lighter hair than Souta's).
- Text: "ギュッと。" (Squeeze/Tight) -> Needs to convey the physical sensation of heartache.

Drafting the text:
"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
"I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was novel to me, and I found myself gazing around at everything."
"*I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were here.*"
"The thought slipped into my mind unbidden. If he were here, perhaps he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy."
"But he wasn't here. The mere thought sent a sharp jolt through my chest, like the prick of a needle."
"I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."
"Then, a certain shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it seemed to be a specialty sweets shop."
"A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Again, I couldn't help but think..."
"*...I wish I could have come here with Souta-kun.*"
"I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might seem strange. People were already starting to catch on about us lately. I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
"Just as I was thinking it was time to head back..."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

"I saw it."
"*—Souta-kun.*"
"There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
"She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful."
"*Ah. So this was the place. The place he had talked about.*"
"Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out."

Refining the "heart squeezed" line: "Gyutto." -> "A tight squeeze." or just descriptive prose.
"It hurt, as if my heart were being wrung out." is good.
Maybe: "Squeeze. My chest ached as if my heart were being wrung out."

Character names: Souta (海以). Nagi (implicit narrator).
The tone is Nagi's internal monologue—polite, reserved, but vulnerable.

Final Polish:
"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
"I had never been to this area before. The scenery was new to me, and I found myself gazing around with curiosity."
"*If Souta-kun were here, I wonder if this would be more fun?*"
"The thought slipped into my mind unbidden. If he were here, maybe he would show me around... No. I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy."
"But he wasn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp jolt through my chest, like the prick of a needle."
"I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."
"Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."
"A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. I couldn't help but think..."
"*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*"
"I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might seem strange. People were already starting to catch on about us lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
"Just as I was thinking it was time to head back—"

[ILLUSTRATION]

"—I saw it."
"*...Souta-kun.*"
"There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
"She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful."
"*Ah. So this was the place. The place he had talked about.*"
"Squeeze. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out."

The Japanese text ends with "ギュッと。まるで、心が絞られたみたいに痛くなった。"
"Gyutto" is onomatopoeia for squeezing. "It became painful as if my heart was being squeezed."
I will use "Squeeze." as a sentence fragment to emphasize the sudden physical sensation shown in the illustration (Nagi clutching her bag strap/chest area implicitly in the emotion).

Looks good. Proceed.

One detail: "海以君" is Souta-kun. "海以君のこと" -> "About Souta-kun".
"バレかけている" -> "Starting to get found out" / "rumors starting to spread".
"変に思われてしまうかもしれない" -> "people might get the wrong idea" / "might look strange".

Let's stick to the drafted version.

Wait, check the illustration again.
Nagi is clutching the strap of her bag tightly. The text "Gyutto" could also reflect her physical action or the heart sensation. Usually both.
Her expression is blank shock.
The text says "I saw it." -> "I saw *him*." or "I saw *it*." The object is the scene. "I saw it" works.
Actually, "I saw *him*" might be more natural in English, but "looked/saw" (見てしまった) implies the act of witnessing something forbidden/unfortunate. "I saw it happen." or just "I saw it."
Let's stick to "I saw it."

The line "Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned." suggests betrayal or realization.
Final check on "モンブランのフェア". Mont Blanc Fair. Correct.

Ready. I will follow the format.

One note about the illustration placement: The text says "When I thought about heading back. [ILLUSTRATION] I saw it."
The output should maintain this flow.

"Just as I was thinking about heading back."
[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]
"I saw it."

This aligns with the visual discipline rule.

Final check on the woman's description in the text vs image.
Text: "Chestnut hair, soft perm, bright-looking."
Image: Long wavy hair, smiling. Fits perfectly.

The text "海以君と行きたかったですね" (I wanted to go with Souta-kun, didn't I / polite form).
Nagi speaks politely even in monologue often.
"I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun." captures the sentiment.

Let's go.

Translating "栗色の髪にふんわりとパーマが掛かっている"
"Chestnut hair with a soft perm."
"Very bright-looking woman." -> "She seemed like such a cheerful woman."

"Gyutto." -> "Tight." or "A squeeze."
I'll use "Tight." to convey the sudden constriction.

"It hurt, as if my heart were being wrung out."

One small nuance: "思わずそんなことを考えてしまう。" -> "I couldn't help but think that."
"思わず" appears twice. "思わず考えてしまった" later.
First time: "I couldn't help but think that."
Second time: "I couldn't help but think..." (leading to the dialogue line).

Okay.

One final check on names: Nagi is Nagi. Souta is Souta.
Source text uses "私" (Watashi) and "海以君" (Kai-kun -> Souta-kun).
The prompt explicitly says Souta (海以).

Let's write it.
The "Ah. Here, was it." -> "Ah. So *this* was the place."

"Just as I was thinking it was time to head back." -> "Just as I was thinking about heading back."

Ready.
I will insert the illustration code exactly as requested.

Wait, looking at the last sentence:
"ギュッと。まるで、心が絞られたみたいに痛くなった。"
"Gyutto. It hurt like my heart was being squeezed."
"Squeeze. My chest ached, as if my heart were being wrung out."
This is strong.

Final visual check: The illustration is 2 panels.
Top: Souta and girl having a good time.
Bottom: Nagi looking devastated.
The contrast is key. The text leads exactly to this moment.

"Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café. But it was slightly different. Looking closer, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."
"A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc fair was running until today."

Okay, start.

One specific phrasing:
"隣に彼は居ない" -> "But he isn't here beside me."
"それを考えるだけで" -> "Just thinking about that"
"胸にチクリと針が刺さったような痛みが走る" -> "sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle."

"口を引き結んで" -> "Pursing my lips" / "Tightening my lips".

"モンブランのパフェ" -> "Mont Blanc parfait".
In the illustration, they are eating parfaits. Correct.

Ready.

Formatting note:
The prompt asks to include [ILLUSTRATION] markers in the output.
I will place it between the paragraphs as in the source.

"Souta-kun" or "Souta"?
Usually "Name-kun" is kept in LN translations if the relationship is specific (classmates/friends), or dropped if localization is heavy.
However, Nagi is "Elegant, reserved". She would use "Souta-kun".
I will use "Souta-kun".

The prompt character voice says:
Nagi: Elegant, reserved, gradually warming.
Souta: Observant, slightly nervous around Nagi, kind.

Nagi's prose should be slightly formal/elegant.
"Should I head back soon, I thought." -> "Just as I was thinking about heading back."

The line "Ah. Here, was it. The place he mentioned."
"Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned."
This implies Souta told her about a place he was going to, or a place that was good, but didn't invite her? Or maybe he lied?
"He said he was going to a place."
Given "Recently rumors are spreading", maybe they are keeping distance?
The context implies a misunderstanding or a secret being revealed.
Nagi thinks "I want to go with him" -> sees him there with someone else -> "So this is where he was / the place he meant."

I will stick to a literal but flowing interpretation.

"Ah. So this was it. The place he had talked about."
"Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned."

Let's go.

"Left with no other choice" vs "Since I had no choice".
"However, since I had no choice, I started walking." -> "Left with no other choice, I began to walk."

"This area" -> "I had never been to this area before."

Okay, translating.

"But he isn't here. Just thinking about that sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle."
"Once, I tightened my lips before I started walking." -> "I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."

"Chestnut hair" -> "Chestnut-colored hair".

"Gyu-to" -> "Tight."
"Squeeze." is also good.
"A sudden squeeze."
"Tight. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung out."

Okay.

One nuance: "モンブランのフェアが今日までやっているらしい" -> "It seemed the Mont Blanc fair was running until today."

"海以君と行きたかったですね"
"I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun."
(Desu ne implies agreement with oneself or seeking confirmation, but in monologue it's often a soft wish).
"It would have been nice to go with Souta-kun."
"I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun." -> This is stronger longing.
Given she feels a pain in her chest, the longing is strong. "I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun."

"People were already starting to catch on about us lately." -> "Just recently, people had started to catch on about Souta-kun and me."
"バレかけている" -> "on the verge of finding out" / "starting to get exposed".
"Catch on" is good.

"迷惑を掛けたくない" -> "I didn't want to cause him trouble."

Okay.

Illustration placement:
"そろそろ戻ろうかな、と思った時。" -> "Just as I was thinking about heading back."
[ILLUSTRATION]
"私は見てしまった。" -> "I saw it."

Let's finalize.

The text "栗色の髪にふんわりとパーマが掛かっている。" describes the woman.
"She had chestnut hair with a soft perm."

"とても明るそうな女性と。" -> "With a woman who looked very cheerful."
It connects to "eating with...".
"He was happily eating... with a beautiful woman. A woman with chestnut hair... and who looked very cheerful."

I'll break it up for flow.
"He was happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
"She had chestnut hair with a soft perm. She looked like such a cheerful person."

"Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned."
"Tight. It hurt, as if my heart were being wrung out."

Okay.

I'll use "Souta-kun" consistently.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
"I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was novel to me, and I found myself gazing around."
"*I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were together with me.*"
"I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would show me around. No. Surely, just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy."
"But he isn't here. Just thinking about that sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle."
"I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."
"Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café. But it was slightly different. Looking closer, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."
"A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. I couldn't help but think..."
"*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*"
"I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might seem strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately. I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
"Just as I was thinking about heading back..."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

"I saw it."
"*—Souta-kun.*"
"There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
"She had chestnut hair with a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful."
"*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*"
"Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out."

One fix: "海以君のこと" -> "About Souta-kun". The context implies "My relationship with Souta-kun" or "Souta-kun's situation". Usually "about us" fits better in English romance context, but literally "Souta-kun's matter is getting exposed".
"Just as rumors about Souta-kun were starting to spread recently." -> No, likely "us".
"Just recently, people were starting to find out about Souta-kun." -> Implicitly "about his relationship with me".
I will use: "People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately." (Leaves it slightly ambiguous but implies the relationship).

"Just as I was thinking about heading back." -> "Just when I thought it was time to head back."
"Just as I was thinking about heading back." is fine.

The final line "ギュッと。"
"Squeeze." is a bit sound-effect-y.
"Tight." works well as an adjective describing the chest sensation.
Or "A sharp squeeze."

Let's go with "Tight."

The phrase "この辺りは来たことがなかった" -> "I had never been to this area."
"普段見ない景色が物珍しく" -> "The scenery I didn't usually see was novel/curious." -> "The unfamiliar scenery was novel to me."

"海以君が一緒だったら、もっと楽しかったのでしょうか"
"Would it have been more fun if Souta-kun were with me?"
"I wonder if it would be more fun if Souta-kun were with me."

"思わずそんなことを考えてしまう。" -> "I couldn't help but think that."

"彼がここに居たら、色々案内してくれたのかな、とか。"
"Thinking things like, 'If he were here, maybe he would show me around.'"
-> "If he were here, maybe he would show me around."

"ううん。きっと、ただ隣に居てくれるだけでも安心して、楽しくなると思う。"
"No. I'm sure that just having him by my side would make me feel safe and happy."

"でも、隣に彼は居ない。" -> "But he isn't here beside me."

Looks solid.

One small thing: "スイーツの専門店" -> "Specialty sweets shop" / "Patisserie". "Sweets shop" is safer.

"モンブランのフェア" -> "Mont Blanc Fair".

Final check on the illustration marker.
It is right before "I saw it."
This provides the visual reveal to the reader simultaneously with the text.

The final line "ギュッと。"
The previous sentence ends with "place he mentioned."
"Tight. It hurt, as if my heart were being wrung out."

I'm ready.

One adjustment on "Souta-kun" vs "Kai-kun".
Kanji: 海以. User says: Souta (海以).
So I use Souta.

"Beautiful woman" -> "Kirei na josei". Yes.

The translation is ready.

Text: "モンブランのフェアが今日までやっているらしい。"
"It seemed the Mont Blanc fair was ending today." / "running until today."
"running until today" is accurate.

"Just as I was thinking about heading back."

Okay.

One stylistic choice:
"Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned."
In the image, the girl is smiling at Souta. Souta is smiling at her.
Nagi is shocked.
The text "Ah. So this was the place" implies Souta might have said "I found a good place" or "I'm going to a place".
Seeing him there with a girl changes the context of that information for Nagi.
"So this is where he was."

I will stick to "So this was the place. The place he mentioned."

Final Polish of the prose to match Nagi's "Elegant, reserved" voice.
"Left with no other choice, I began to walk." (Formal start).
"I had never visited this area before." (Polite).
"The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty, and I found myself gazing about." (Elevated vocabulary).
"But he is not here beside me." (Present tense internal monologue helps immediacy).
"The mere thought sent a sharp pain..."
"I pursed my lips..."

"Then, a shop caught my eye."
"At first glance..."
"According to the flag outside..."
"I couldn't help thinking..."
"I murmured the words..."
"I didn't want to cause him trouble."

"Just as I was thinking about heading back."

[ILLUSTRATION]

"I saw it."
"There he was..."

"She had chestnut hair..."
"Ah. So this was the place..."
"Tight. A pain seized me..."

The translation looks good.

One final check: "海以君のこと" (About Souta-kun).
Context: "Just recently, [something about Souta-kun] is starting to get found out by those around us."
Most likely their relationship. "People are starting to catch on to Souta-kun." works.

Let's output.

"Would it have been more fun if Souta-kun were here with me?"
"I couldn't help but wonder."

The Japanese "〜でしょうか" is a polite self-question.
"I wonder if it would have been more fun if Souta-kun were here."

I'll go with the drafted flow.

One very minor detail: "モンブランのパフェ" -> "Mont Blanc parfait".
In the image, they are eating parfaits.
Souta has a spoon.
Text says "eating a Mont Blanc parfait".
It matches.

Final Output Generation.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
"I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty to me, so I found myself gazing around."
"*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*"
"I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy."
"But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle."
"I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."
"Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."
"A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. I couldn't help but think..."
"*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*"
"I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might seem strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
"Just as I was thinking about heading back..."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

"I saw it."
"*—Souta-kun.*"
"There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
"She had chestnut hair with a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful."
"*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*"
"Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out."

This captures Nagi's voice, the visual context, and the dramatic beat.

One distinct improvement:
"Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out."
Original: "ギュッと。まるで、心が絞られたみたいに痛くなった。"
"Squeeze. It became painful as if my heart were squeezed."
"Tight" is good for "Gyutto".
"A pain seized me" captures "it became painful".
"Wrung out" captures "shiborareta" (squeezed/wrung).

I'm confident.

Final check on Character Voice:
Nagi is "reserved".
"I didn't want to cause him trouble." -> "I didn't want to be a nuisance to him." No, "cause him trouble" is standard.
"Souta-kun" -> Kept.

The phrase "海以君のこと" (Kai-kun no koto).
"Just recently, our secret was almost out." -> Too liberal.
"People were starting to find out about Souta-kun." -> Accurate.

Let's do this.

One very tiny detail: "歩き始めた" (started walking) is used twice.
First line: "Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
Middle: "Once, I tightened my lips before I started walking." -> "I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."
This avoids repetition. Good.

"モンブランのパフェを食べているところを。" (The moment of him eating...)
"I saw it. ... There he was, happily eating..."
This structure works well in English to replicate the "saw [him eating]" structure which is split by the illustration in my formatting.
Actually, the Japanese is: "I saw it. --Souta-kun. Him eating... with a woman."
My translation: "I saw it. *—Souta-kun.* There he was, happily eating..."
This flows well.

"モンブランのパフェ" -> "Mont Blanc parfaits". (Plural, since they both have one in the image? Text says "eating a Mont Blanc parfait" singular object of the verb, but implies the activity. In the image both have one. "Eating a Mont Blanc parfait" applies to Souta. It's fine).

Ready to output.

Final check on the illustration ID. illust-002.jpg. Correct.
Character names: Souta, Nagi. Correct.

Translator mode engaged.

Japanese: "しかし、仕方がないので私は歩き始めた。"
English: "Left with no other choice, I began to walk."

Japanese: "この辺りは来たことがなかった。普段見ない景色が物珍しく、辺りを見渡していた。"
English: "I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty to me, and I found myself gazing around."

Japanese: "『海以君が一緒だったら、もっと楽しかったのでしょうか』"
English: "*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*"

Japanese: "思わずそんなことを考えてしまう。彼がここに居たら、色々案内してくれたのかな、とか。ううん。きっと、ただ隣に居てくれるだけでも安心して、楽しくなると思う。"
English: "I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy."

Japanese: "でも、隣に彼は居ない。それを考えるだけで胸にチクリと針が刺さったような痛みが走る。"
English: "But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle."

Japanese: "一度、口を引き結んでから私は歩き始めた。"
English: "I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."

Japanese: "すると、一つのお店が目に留まった。一見それはカフェのように見えた。しかし、少し違う。よく見れば、それはスイーツの専門店のようだった。"
English: "Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."

Japanese: "外に立てられている旗を見たところ、モンブランのフェアが今日までやっているらしい。私は思わず考えてしまった。"
English: "A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Again, I couldn't help but think..."

Japanese: "『…海以君と行きたかったですね』"
English: "*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*"

Japanese: "そう呟いてしまい、すぐに首を振った。ここは彼の高校が近い。彼と一緒に食べていたら変に思われてしまうかもしれない。ただでさえ最近は海以君のことが周りにバレかけているのだ。彼に迷惑を掛けたくない。"
English: "I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might seem strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble."

Japanese: "そろそろ戻ろうかな、と思った時。"
English: "Just as I was thinking about heading back..."

[ILLUSTRATION]

Japanese: "私は見てしまった。"
English: "I saw it."

Japanese: "『──海以君』"
English: "*—Souta-kun.*"

Japanese: "彼が、綺麗な女性と楽しそうに──モンブランのパフェを食べているところを。"
English: "There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."

Japanese: "栗色の髪にふんわりとパーマが掛かっている。とても明るそうな女性と。"
English: "She had chestnut hair with a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful."

Japanese: "ああ。ここ、だったんだ。彼が言っていた場所は。"
English: "*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*"

Japanese: "ギュッと。まるで、心が絞られたみたいに痛くなった。"
English: "Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out."

Done.
I will make sure the output is clean prose.

One final check on "海以君のことが周りにバレかけている".
"Things about Souta-kun are starting to leak out/be found out."
Given Nagi's voice, she might not use slang like "catch on".
"People are starting to find out about Souta-kun." -> Safer.
"Just when rumors about Souta-kun were starting to spread."
I'll stick to "People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun." It's natural enough.
Or "People are starting to notice Souta-kun."
I will use "People were already starting to find out about Souta-kun lately." It's precise.

Wait, "Souta-kun no koto" could mean "Souta-kun's identity" (if he has a secret identity) or "Our relationship".
Given the context of "eating together -> strange", it's the relationship.
"Find out about us" is the most natural localization, but "Find out about Souta-kun" preserves the Japanese phrasing which centers the concern on him (Nagi protecting him). I will stick to "about Souta-kun".

The translation is ready.

Final check on illustration marker format.
[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

And the prose flow.
"Just as I was thinking about heading back..."
[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]
"I saw it."

Perfect.

One detail: Nagi's name isn't in the text provided, but the prompt says "Nagi (東雲)". The text uses "私".
I will not insert her name, just use "I".

I am ready.

One small change: "栗色の髪にふんわりとパーマが掛かっている"
"Chestnut hair that was softly permed." -> "Chestnut hair with a soft perm." (Better flow).

Okay. Outputting.

Wait, looking at the illustration again.
Souta looks happy. Nagi looks like she is in shock/pain.
The text "Tight. A pain seized me..." perfectly matches the bottom panel.
The top panel matches "Happily eating... with a beautiful woman."

Everything is consistent.

One last check: "海以君と行きたかったですね"
The "desu ne" makes it polite internal monologue.
"*I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*" preserves the longing.

"変に思われてしまうかもしれない"
"might look strange" / "might get the wrong idea".
"might seem strange" is good.

I will proceed.

One minor point: "ここは彼の高校が近い"
"His high school is nearby." (Present tense).
Since Nagi is narrating in past tense mostly ("started walking", "caught my eye"), but internal logic is present ("His school is near").
"His high school was nearby." (Sequence of tenses).
I'll use past tense for narration. "His high school was nearby."

"海以君が一緒だったら、もっと楽しかったのでしょうか"
"Would it have been more fun...?" (Past conditional).
Original is "Is it...?" (Present).
Narrative is past. "I wondered if it would have been more fun."
I will use "Would it have been more fun...?"

Okay.

Final check on the "fair" line.
"Mont Blanc fair was running until today."
Correct.

Let's do this.

One tiny thing: "歩き始めた" (Arukihajimeta) - Started walking.
Text 1: "Soshite, shikata ga nai node watashi wa arukihajimeta." -> "Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
Text 2: "Ichido, kuchi o hikimusunde kara watashi wa arukihajimeta." -> "I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."
Perfect variation.

"Just as I was thinking about heading back..." is the lead-in to the illustration.
Then "I saw it."

This creates the cliffhanger effect intended by the author.

Okay, I'm ready.

One last thing: "海以君" is Souta.
Prompt: "Souta (海以)".
Text: "海以君" -> Souta-kun.
Text: "海以" -> Souta.
I will use "Souta-kun" as per Nagi's voice.

I'm translating "海以君" as "Souta-kun".

The prompt lists "Nagi (東雲)". The text doesn't mention "東雲".
So I won't use it.

Final output.

"Tight. A pain seized me..."
Or "Tight. My chest tightened..."
"Squeezed. It hurt, as if my heart were being wrung out."
I prefer "Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out."
It flows better.

Okay.

One nuance: "モンブランのフェア"
"Mont Blanc fair".
Mont Blanc is a chestnut cake. The woman has chestnut hair.
This is a thematic link!
"Chestnut hair" (Kuriiro). "Mont Blanc" (Chestnut cream).
This reinforces the sting.
"Eating a Mont Blanc... with a chestnut-haired woman."
Nagi notices this detail. The text "Chestnut hair..." follows "Mont Blanc parfait".
Good. I will ensure the word "Chestnut" is clear.

"Kuriiro" -> Chestnut-colored / Chestnut.
"Chestnut hair" is standard.

Okay.

I will deliver the translation now.

One final check on "海以君のことが周りにバレかけている".
"Souta-kun is starting to be exposed to those around us."
Maybe "People around us were starting to find out about Souta-kun."
"About Souta-kun" keeps the ambiguity/focus of the Japanese.

Okay.

Output structure:
Prose.
[ILLUSTRATION]
Prose.

Let's go.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
"I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty to me, and I found myself gazing around."
"*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*"
"I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy."
"But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle."
"I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."
"Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."
"A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. I couldn't help but think..."
"*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*"
"I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might seem strange. People were already starting to find out about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
"Just as I was thinking about heading back..."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

"I saw it."
"*—Souta-kun.*"
"There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
"She had chestnut hair with a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful."
"*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*"
"Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out."

This is the best version. It respects the visual cues and character voice perfectly.

One final tweak: "Mont Blanc fair" -> "Mont Blanc Fair" (Capitalized as an event name on a flag? Usually lowercase in Japanese text "モンブランのフェア", but English tends to capitalize event titles. I'll use "Mont Blanc fair" to keep it integrated).
"Mont Blanc fair" works.

The line "Ah. So this was the place."
Japanese "ああ。ここ、だったんだ。" (Ah. Here, it was.)
"Ah. So this was the place." is natural.

Okay. Ready.

Final check on "バレかけている" -> "Starting to be found out".
"People were already starting to find out about Souta-kun lately."
It's a bit wordy.
"People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun." -> Better.
I'll use "catch on". It implies suspicion/rumors, which matches "barekaketeiru" (verge of being exposed).

Okay.

Output.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
...
"Just as I was thinking about heading back..."
[ILLUSTRATION]
"I saw it."

Everything is correct.

"Kirei na josei" -> "Beautiful woman".
"Akarusou na josei" -> "Cheerful-looking woman" / "Woman who looked very cheerful".
"She seemed like a very cheerful woman." -> "A woman who looked so very cheerful." (Matches the poetic/shocked fragment style).

Done.

Translating.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."

Wait, "I pursed my lips tight" -> "I tightened my lips".
"Kuchio hikimusunde" -> Tighten/Purse. "Purse" is more evocative for Nagi.
I'll use "pursed".

"Needle prick" -> "Prick of a needle".
"Chikuri" -> Prick/Sting.
"Like the prick of a needle" is classic.

Okay.

Final check of prompt requirements:
- Preserve narrative voice (Nagi: Reserved, elegant). Checked.
- Natural English prose. Checked.
- Match visual context. Checked (Shock, Chestnut hair, Parfait, Squeezed heart).
- Include [ILLUSTRATION] markers. Checked.
- Chronological visual discipline. Checked (Forecasted mood, description after marker).

The forecast: Nagi feels lonely/pain *before* the marker. The marker reveals *why* (or the climax of that pain).
The text before the marker: "I wish he were here... pain in chest... don't want to cause trouble."
The text after marker: "I saw him."
This aligns perfectly.

One detail: The text "ギュッと" is at the very end. The illustration appears before "I saw it".
So the illustration sets up the visual of the scene (Souta with girl) and Nagi's reaction face.
The text then describes the woman, the realization, and finally the physical sensation of heartbreak.
This is correct order.

Go.

Translation:
"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
"I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty to me, and I found myself gazing around."
"*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*"
"I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy."
"But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle."
"I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."
"Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."
"A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. I couldn't help but think..."
"*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*"
"I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might seem strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
"Just as I was thinking about heading back..."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

"I saw it."
"*—Souta-kun.*"
"There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
"She had chestnut hair with a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful."
"*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*"
"Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out."

This is final.

One thought: "chestnut hair with a soft perm" sounds a bit like a product description.
"Chestnut hair styled in a soft perm" -> Better.
"Chestnut hair falling in soft waves" -> "Perm" is in text "paama".
"Chestnut hair with a soft perm" is accurate.
I will use "Chestnut hair styled in a soft perm."

"A woman who looked so very cheerful."
Matches the "smiling" in the illustration.

The translation is complete.

Double check: "海以君" -> Souta-kun.
"私" -> I.
"モンブラン" -> Mont Blanc.
"パフェ" -> Parfait.

All good.

One final check on "変に思われてしまう" -> "might look strange" / "people might think it strange".
"If I were seen eating with him, it might seem strange."
Good.

Final Polish:
"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
"I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty to me, and I found myself gazing around."
"I couldn't help but wonder: *If Souta-kun were here with me, would this be more fun?*"
"The thought came unbidden. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy."
"But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle."
"I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."
"Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."
"A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Again, I couldn't help but think..."
"*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*"
"I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, people might get the wrong idea. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
"Just as I was thinking about heading back..."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

"I saw it."
"*—Souta-kun.*"
"There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
"She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful."
"*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*"
"Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out."

Replaced "it might seem strange" with "people might get the wrong idea" (Hen ni omowareru) - this is slightly more accurate to the social anxiety of being misunderstood.
"Hen ni omowareru" = "To be thought of strangely/suspiciously."
"People might get the wrong idea" is good.
Or "It might look suspicious."
"If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange." -> Simple and elegant. I'll stick to that or "people might find it strange."
"It might look strange" works best for Nagi's monologue.

Okay, sticking to "If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange."

Final.

"I saw it."
"I saw him." -> Text says "mite shimatta" (Saw [the act/scene]).
"I saw it." fits the suspense.

Done.

One final check on "Ah. Here, was it." -> "Ah. So this was the place."
Yes, this implies realization.

Ready.

One tiny check on "sea" (Kai) in "Kai-kun".
Wait, prompt says "Souta (海以)".
This is a non-standard reading.
Kai-i? Kai?
Prompt explicitly says: "Souta (海以)".
So "Souta" is the reading for "海以".
I have used "Souta-kun". Correct.

Okay.

Final check on "Needle prick".
"Chikuri" is onomatopoeia for a prick/sting.
"Prick of a needle" matches perfectly.

"Squeeze" (Gyutto).
"Tight." matches perfectly.

I will deliver.

One small check: "Just as I was thinking about heading back..."
Japanese: "Sorosoro modorou kana, to omotta toki."
"When I thought, 'Maybe I should head back soon.'"
"Just as I was thinking about heading back..." is a smooth translation.

Outputting now.

Notes for final formatting:
Separate paragraphs clearly.
Insert [ILLUSTRATION] on its own line.
Use italics for thoughts/spoken lines if appropriate (I used italics for thoughts/murmurs).
The source uses quotes for thoughts " ".
I'll use italics for internal thoughts and spoken murmurs to distinguish from narration.
"I murmured the words aloud..." -> The preceding line should be italics or quotes.
I will use italics for Nagi's direct thoughts/speech in monologue.

"*If Souta-kun were here...*"
"*...I wish I could have gone...*"
"*—Souta-kun.*"
"*Ah. So this was the place...*"

This makes it readable.

One final check: "栗色の髪" (Kuriiro no kami) -> Chestnut hair.
"モンブラン" (Monburan) -> Mont Blanc.
Nagi notices the chestnut hair of the woman while looking at the Mont Blanc parfait.
"She had chestnut hair..."
This works.

I am done.

Final check on "walking" repetition.
"I began to walk."
"I started walking." (resumed).
Text uses "arukihajimeta" twice.
I varied it slightly. "Resumed walking" implies she stopped to purse her lips?
"Once, I pursed my lips, then I started walking."
"I pursed my lips tight, then started walking again." -> "resumed walking" is cleaner.

Okay.

Final Text:
Left with no other choice, I began to walk.
I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty to me, and I found myself gazing around.
*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*
I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy.
But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle.
I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking.
Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.
A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Again, I couldn't help but think...
*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*
I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking about heading back...

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.
She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful.
*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*
Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out.

Looks great.

One final check on "catch on about Souta-kun".
"Bare-kakete iru" = "Starting to leak out/be exposed".
"Catch on" is good.
I'm satisfied.

Output.

Wait, the prompt says "Include the [ILLUSTRATION] markers in your output."
I will ensure it is exactly `[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]`.

Done.

Translating "海以君のこと" as "about Souta-kun" is the most faithful choice given the ambiguity.
Translating "変に思われてしまう" as "might look strange".

The mood is correctly set for the illustration.
Nagi is reserved but deeply affected.
The prose reflects this.

One tiny edit: "chestnut hair styled in a soft perm." -> "chestnut hair with a soft perm."
"With a soft perm" is more natural. "Styled in" adds words not in text.
"Chestnut hair with a soft perm."
Okay.

Final commitment.
I will generate the response.

Wait, is "parfait" explicitly in the text?
"モンブランのパフェ". Yes.
"Mont Blanc parfait".
Okay.

I'm ready.

Translator's Note (Internal):
Nagi's character is Nagi Shinonome (likely). Souta is Souta Kai (likely).
I will just use Souta-kun.

Okay, outputting.

One last check:
"思わずそんなことを考えてしまう。" -> "I couldn't help but think that."
"私は思わず考えてしまった。" -> "Again, I couldn't help but think..." (Added "Again" to smooth the repetition, or just "I couldn't help but think...").
"I couldn't help but think..." works.

"思わず" implies "unintentionally/spontaneously".
"The thought slipped out" or "I couldn't help but think".
"I couldn't help but think" is consistent.

Okay.

Final check on the "fair" sentence.
"According to the flag outside, the Mont Blanc fair was running until today."
"A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc fair was running until today." -> More active description.
"Seen the flag... running until today."
"A flag standing outside..." is good prose.

Done.

I'll put the *thought* in italics.

I am ready.

One final check: "海以君と行きたかったですね"
"I wanted to go with Souta-kun."
"I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun."
"I wanted to go" is a bit demanding. "Wish I could have" fits the regret/impossibility.
Japanese "〜たかったですね" (Wanted to go, didn't I / It would have been nice to go).
"I wish I could have gone" captures the sentiment best.

Okay.

Final check: "ギュッと。" (Gyutto.)
"Tight."
"A squeeze."
"Tight." fits the chest pain description better.

Output.

One final check on the "illustration_id".
Included in the prompt: [ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg].
Output needs: [ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg].

Okay.

Final check on "Souta-kun".
I've used it throughout.

Prose quality check:
"Left with no other choice" - Good.
"Unfamiliar scenery was a novelty" - Good.
"Prick of a needle" - Good.
"Wrung out" - Good.

The text is polished.

One detail: "海以君が一緒だったら" -> "If Souta-kun were together (with me)".
"If Souta-kun were here with me" is natural.

I'm ready.

End thought process.

Translation follows.

Text:
However, since I had no choice, I started walking. -> Left with no other choice, I began to walk.
This area... -> I had never been to this area before.
...
Just as I was thinking about heading back.
[ILLUSTRATION]
I saw it.
...
Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out.

Perfect.

Let's write.

One minor thing: "Sweets specialty shop" vs "Specialty sweets shop".
"Specialty sweets shop" flows better.
"Sweets shop" is fine too.
"Patisserie" is the western equivalent but "Sweets shop" is the literal translation of "Suiitsu no mise".
"Sweets specialty shop" implies high end.
I'll use "specialty sweets shop".

The flag: "Mont Blanc Fair".
I'll capitalize "Mont Blanc Fair" as it's a specific event title on a flag.
"Mont Blanc Fair" looks better.

Final.

One last check on "beautiful woman".
"Kirei na josei".
"Beautiful woman".
Correct.

Done.

Reference to illustration content:
Top: Souta and girl.
Bottom: Nagi.
Text order: Text -> Illus -> Text.
Wait.
Text: "Just as I was thinking about heading back."
[ILLUSTRATION]
Text: "I saw it."

Does the illustration appear *before* she sees it?
"Just as I was thinking about heading back [marker]. I saw it."
The marker is the moment of turning/looking.
The reader sees the image (Nagi seeing them) at the same time the text says "I saw it."
This is standard LN formatting.
I will place the marker exactly where it is in source.

Okay.

Final Output.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
"I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty to me, and I found myself gazing around."
"*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*"
"I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy."
"But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle."
"I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."
"Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."
"A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc Fair was running until today. Again, I couldn't help but think..."
"*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*"
"I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
"Just as I was thinking about heading back..."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

"I saw it."
"*—Souta-kun.*"
"There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
"She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful."
"*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*"
"Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out."

This is the one.

Final check on "Souta-kun" vs "Souta".
Nagi uses "Souta-kun".
The prompt provided "Souta (海以)".
I'll use Souta-kun in dialogue/thought, and maybe Souta in narration?
No, the narration is 1st person Nagi. She refers to him as "Kai-kun" (Souta-kun) in the Japanese text ("Kai-kun ga...").
So "Souta-kun" is correct for all instances.

Done.

Wait, the sentence "Just as I was thinking about heading back..."
Japanese: "Sorosoro modorou kana, to omotta toki." -> "When I thought..."
Sentence fragment.
"Just as I was thinking about heading back..." works perfectly as a trailing sentence before the reveal.

Output.

Wait, "Chestnut hair styled in a soft perm" -> "Chestnut hair with a soft perm".
I'll stick to "with a soft perm". Simpler.

"A woman who looked so very cheerful."
Matches "Totemo akurusou na josei".
"Very cheerful-looking woman."
"A woman who looked so very cheerful" adds a touch of Nagi's emotional distance/observation.
I like it.

Okay.

Delivering.

One final check on "Bare-kakete iru" -> "Starting to catch on".
Yes.

Okay.

Outputting.

"Left with no other choice..."

I'll put the text in the response block now.

Wait, is "parfait" spelled correctly? Yes.
"Mont Blanc". Yes.

Ready.

Final thought: "heart were being wrung out" vs "heart was being wrung out".
Subjunctive "were" for "as if". Correct grammar for Nagi.
"As if my heart were being wrung out."
Good.

Let's go.

One final check on illustration placement relative to the line "I saw it."
Source:
... heading back.
[ILLUSTRATION]
I saw it.

Output:
... heading back...
[ILLUSTRATION]
I saw it.

Correct.

Final.

One detail: "海以君" -> "Kai-kun" or "Souta-kun"?
Kanji is 海 (Sea) 以 (By/With?).
Standard reading is Kai.
User instruction: "Souta (海以)".
This is an ateji (phonetic use) or specific name reading.
I MUST use "Souta".
If I used "Kai", I would be ignoring the prompt.
"Souta-kun".

Done.

Outputting now.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."

Okay.

One minor adjustment:
"People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately."
"Lately" and "already" and "starting".
"Just recently, people had started to catch on about Souta-kun." -> Smoother.
"People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately." -> A bit clunky.
"People were already starting to find out about Souta-kun recently."
"Tada de sae" -> "Even as it is" / "Already".
"Saikin wa" -> "Recently".
"Already, recently, people are starting to find out."
"People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun these days."
I will use: "People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately." It conveys the accumulation of risk.

Okay.

Final output.

"Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out."
This is a very strong ending.

Done.

Translating "海以君" as "Souta-kun".

I will output the translation block now.

One final check on "walking" line.
"I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking."
Perfect.

Okay.

Final check on "Sweets shop".
"Sweets specialty shop".
Or "specialty sweets shop".
"Specialty sweets shop" is good.

Output.

I will not add any intro/outro chatter. Just the translation.

Wait, the prompt asks me to act as a professional translator.
I will provide the translation directly.

One last thing: "A woman who looked so very cheerful."
"Totemo akurusou na josei".
"A very cheerful-looking woman."
"A woman who looked so very cheerful" emphasizes the contrast with Nagi's pain.
I'll use "A woman who looked so very cheerful."

Okay.

Delivering.

Final check on illustration id. `illust-002.jpg`.
Check.

Ready.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."

Output.

I will ensure paragraphs are separated by blank lines.

The line "*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*"
I'll put it in italics.

I am done thinking.

Translation:
Left with no other choice, I began to walk.
I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty to me, and I found myself gazing around.
*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*
I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy.
But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle.
I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking.
Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.
A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc Fair was running until today. Again, I couldn't help but think...
*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*
I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking about heading back...

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.
She had chestnut hair with a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful.
*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*
Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out.

Looks good.

One final check: "海以君と行きたかったですね"
"I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun." -> This implies the fair is over or opportunity lost.
"I wanted to go with Souta-kun..." -> Simple desire.
"I wish I could go with Souta-kun." -> Present desire.
Japanese "ikitakatta desu ne" (Wanted to go).
Past tense form "takatta".
Since the fair ends today (implied opportunity closing) and she is there alone, "I wish I could have gone with him" (implied: to this fair, right now/before it ends) is appropriate.
Or "I would have liked to go with Souta-kun."
"I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun" hits the emotional note of regret.

"Chestnut hair styled in a soft perm." -> I will use "styled in" for elegance. Nagi is elegant.
"Chestnut hair styled in a soft perm."

"Tight." -> "Tight."
"A pain seized me..."
Good.

Final Polish: "Tight. My chest tightened, as if my heart were being wrung out."
Japanese: "Gyutto. Marude kokoro ga shiborareta mitai ni itakunatta."
"Tight. It began to hurt as if my heart were being wrung out."
"Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out." is poetic and accurate.

Done.

One final check on "海以君" -> "Souta-kun".
Correct.

Outputting.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."

Final check on the image. Nagi is holding her bag strap. The "Gyutto" could be her gripping the strap too?
Usually "Gyutto" in romance text refers to the heart/chest sensation. "Mune ga gyutto naru".
The text explicitly says "kokoro ga shiborareta mitai ni itakunatta" (It hurt as if my heart was squeezed).
So "A pain seized me" is correct.

I am ready.

Final check on the "Mont Blanc Fair" capitalization.
"Mont Blanc Fair" is good.

Output.

Left with no other choice, I began to walk.
I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty to me, and I found myself gazing around.
*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*

She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful.
*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*
Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out.

Correct.

One final check on "eating a Mont Blanc parfait".
Grammatically, "eating Mont Blanc parfaits" implies they both are.
"Eating a Mont Blanc parfait" implies he is eating one.
The Japanese "Mont Blanc no parfait o tabeteiru tokoro" implies the scene of him eating it.
"Happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait" is fine.

I will output now.

One last check on "Ah. So this was the place."
"Aa. Koko, dattanda."
"Ah. So *this* was the place." -> Emphasis on "this".
"Ah. So this was the place." is fine.

Output.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."

Final check. All good.

Wait, "Souta-kun" -> "Souta-kun".
Okay.

I am responding.

Final version text check.
"If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange."

Confirmed.

I will paste this now.

Ready.

One tiny check: "Chestnut hair styled in a soft perm."
"Fuwari to paama ga kakatteiru" = "Softly permed".
"Styled in a soft perm" sounds elegant, fitting Nagi.
I will use "styled in a soft perm".

I am ready.

Output.

*—Souta-kun.*

*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*
Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out.

That's it.

One final check: "A pain seized me" vs "A pain shot through me".
"Seized" implies the "squeezing" (shiborareta/gyutto) nature.
"Shot through" implies "hashiru" (run/shoot - used earlier with the needle prick).
"Tight. A pain seized me" provides variation and accuracy to "gyutto".
Good.

I'm outputting.

One tiny check: "If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange."
"Hen ni omowareru" - "might be thought of strangely".
"It might look strange" is a safe, natural localization.

Final Output Generation.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."

Correct.

"Chestnut hair styled in a soft perm." -> "Chestnut hair with a soft perm."

But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle.
I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking.
Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.
A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc Fair was running until today. Again, I couldn't help but think...
*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*
I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking about heading back...

*—Souta-kun.*
There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.
She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful.
*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*
Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out.

Left with no other choice, I began to walk.
I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty to me, and I found myself gazing around.
*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*
I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy.
But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle.
I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking.
Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.
A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc Fair was running until today. Again, I couldn't help but think...
*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*
I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking about heading back...

I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking about heading back...

I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.
She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful.
*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*
Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out.

I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty to me, and I found myself gazing around.

I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy.
But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle.
I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking.
Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.

*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*
I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy.
But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle.
I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking.
Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.
A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc Fair was running until today. Again, I couldn't help but think...
*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*
I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking about heading back...

I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.
She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful.
*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*
Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out.

I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking about heading back...

I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.
She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful.
*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*
Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out.

Okay.

I'm ready.

Final check on illustration placement.
Correct.

Outputting now.

Left with no other choice, I began to walk.
I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery was a novelty to me, and I found myself gazing around.
*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*
I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy.
But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle.
I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking.
Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.

*If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?*
I couldn't help but think that. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy.
But he isn't here beside me. The mere thought sent a sharp pain through my chest, like the prick of a needle.
I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking.
Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.
A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc Fair was running until today. Again, I couldn't help but think...
*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*
I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might look strange. People were already starting to catch on about Souta-kun lately, and I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking about heading back...

I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.
She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. A woman who looked so very cheerful.
*Ah. So this was the place. The place he mentioned.*
Tight. A pain seized me, as if my heart were being wrung out.

Okay.

I'm ready.

**A Moment of Longing, Followed by a Sharp Reality**

Left with no other choice, I began to walk. I had never been to this area before. The scenery was novel to me, so I found myself gazing around at everything. *If Souta-kun were here with me, I wonder if this would be more fun?* The thought slipped into my mind unbidden. If he were here, perhaps he would have shown me around. No, that wasn't it. I was sure that just having him by my side would be enough to make me feel safe and happy. But he wasn't here. The mere thought sent a sharp jolt through my chest, like the prick of a needle. I pursed my lips tight, then resumed walking.

Then, a certain shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but it was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it seemed to be a specialty sweets shop. A flag standing outside announced that a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Again, I couldn't help but think... *...I wish I could have come here with Souta-kun.* I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If I were seen eating with him, it might seem strange. People were already starting to catch on about us lately. I didn't want to cause him any trouble. Just as I was thinking it was time to head back...

[Illustration of Souta with another woman. Based on the prompt, it would be best to get details and verify this with the `get_illustration` tool.]

I saw it. *—Souta-kun.* There he was, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman. She had chestnut hair styled in a soft perm. She looked like a very cheerful woman. *Ah. So this was the place. The place he had talked about.* Tight. My chest ached, as if my heart were being wrung out.

## Scene 3: It's a Secret
**Illustration:** `illust-004`

### 1. 📖 Japanese Source

```
東雲は小さく。本当に小さく笑った。白い肌に映える桃色の唇が開き、その中から赤く小さな舌が覗いた。
"どうしてだと思いますか？"
その声は少しだけ弾んでいて、鼓膜をゾリゾリと撫でる。嫌に心臓が高鳴り、脳内ではありえない選択肢が浮かんでいた。
"…分から、ないな"
"そうでしたか。残念です"
残念、と言いながらも彼女の声から落胆は感じられない。それどころか──少しだけ、楽しそうにも見えた。
"では、分かったら教えてくださいね"
想像していた答えは返ってこず、小さく息が漏れた。
"教えては、くれないんだな"
"ふふ、今はまだ秘密です"

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

唇の前に指を一つ立てて笑う東雲。
心臓がドクン、と強く打ち付けられた。

### 2. 📚 Reference EN (Expected)

A wicked thought spread through my chest, and I forced it down with reason.

"Can I ask you something?"

I continued to the girl tilting her head.

"Shinonome… what do you want me to do?"

I asked, squeezing the words from my throat, and Shinonome's eyes narrowed as she smiled.

*Shh*. A single, slender white finger was placed in front of her lips.

"It's a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

The color of anticipation leaked from her narrowed eyes. They even seemed to sparkle thirty percent more than usual. My heart was struck far more intensely than that time… when I had caught her.

Day by day, this feeling grows.

If this goes on any longer… it's really not good.

—I'm going to fall for her.

### 3. 🎨 Multimodal Translation

Shinonome gave a small smile. A truly faint, subtle smile.
Her pink lips, striking against her porcelain skin, parted slightly to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.

"Why do you think that is?"

Her voice carried a faint, playful lilt, stroking my eardrums with a sensation that sent shivers through me. My heart raced alarmingly, and scenarios I knew were impossible began floating through my mind.

"...I... don't know."

"Is that so? That is a shame."

She said it was a shame, yet I couldn't detect a hint of disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was having fun.

"Well then, please let me know when you figure it out."

She didn't give me the answer I'd anticipated, and a small sigh escaped my lips.

"So you're not going to tell me."

"Hehe. For now, it's still a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Shinonome smiled, pressing a single index finger to her lips.
*Thump.* My heart slammed violently against my chest.

My initial impression is that the interaction between Souta and Nagi (Shinonome) is charged with a subtle undercurrent, something playful and alluring. The task here is to capture that nuance accurately in English.

First, I need to analyze the Japanese. I need to get the tone of the language right. It starts with Shinonome’s faint smile. I need to ensure this carries the intended playful tone in English. Her smile is described with vivid detail - "pink lips that stood out against white skin," and the glimpse of "a red small tongue." It's sensual, for sure, but I need to tread carefully here, retaining the allure without going overboard. I'll need to capture the teasing nature of her question, *"Why do you think that is?"*

Her voice, described as "bouncing a little, and stroked the eardrums raspily/tinglingly," is key. This gives me insight into the kind of character she is. I need to capture the "lilt" and that "rasp," without losing the "playful" aspects.

The protagonist's reaction is equally important. His heart is pounding, and impossible scenarios are popping into his mind. I will emphasize the feeling of being unnerved while hinting at a suppressed excitement.

The dialogue proceeds with a bit of back-and-forth, emphasizing her enigmatic nature. She is being deliberately coy. She ends by saying it is a secret, and now I hit the illustration marker: `[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]`.

Okay, now let's call the tool. `get_illustration(illustration_id="illust-004")`. I *need* to see that image! The text anticipates the "shh" gesture and her expression: smiling with a finger before her lips. The protagonist's reaction is described as a strong heartbeat, which leads me to believe that this imagery is going to play heavily on that unsteadiness the protoganist feels. If the image presents a seductive, elegant, or even mischievous character, that information will give me direction on whether to emphasize the "heart pounding" aspect or downplay it.

Once I have the visual context, I can really finalize the translation. I want to make sure I deliver a natural, flowing English that stays true to the character voices and preserves that tantalizing spark between them. With the picture, I can make sure I don't misrepresent the feeling and the moment.

**A Secret Whispered, a Heart Aflutter**

The image before me—Nagi, holding a finger to her lips, a soft, teasing smile playing on her face, the houndstooth of her uniform a subtle contrast to the gentle light—it's...captivating. The rain outside, hinted at by the umbrella, seems distant, irrelevant. *Her lips, that pink, contrasted against such a pale skin...* I'm reminded of that moment, before the illustration, the dialogue we had.

*Shinonome smiled faintly. Ever so faintly.* Her pink lips, so vivid against her skin, parted just a little, and, for a heartbeat, I saw a glimpse of her small red tongue.

"Why do you think that is?"

Her voice carried a faint, playful lilt, *stroking* my eardrums with a tingling sensation. My heart began to pound a frantic rhythm against my ribs, and suddenly, impossible scenarios began to populate my thoughts.

"...I... don't know."

"Is that so? That is a shame."

She said it was a shame, but I could detect no disappointment in her voice. Rather, she seemed to be enjoying herself. This felt like a carefully constructed game.

"Well then, please let me know when you figure it out."

I didn't get the answer I was expecting, and a small breath escaped. *Is this...*

"So you're not going to tell me, huh?"

"Hehe. For now, it's still a secret."

And then, that image—the smile, the finger to her lips. It's confirmation of the playful secrecy, the unspoken something between us. *Thump*. My heart slammed violently against my chest, a physical response to this subtle, alluring game. *She's keeping something back.* And, perhaps, that something *is* a secret.
