Direct translations should be avoided unless culturally significant and explained. For example, 'senpai' can be retained if the context of junior/senior relationship is crucial, or translated to 'senior'/'upperclassman' where appropriate. 'Sensei' can be retained for teachers. Casual suffixes like -chan, -kun should be reflected in tone and word choice rather than direct translation, or omitted if the relationship is clear."
