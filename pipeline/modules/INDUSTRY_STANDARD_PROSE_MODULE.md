# 1. Gold Standard Principles

## 1.1 The Yen Press/J-Novel Club Standard

**Goal:** Prose should read as if it was **originally written in English**, not like English words arranged in Japanese patterns.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Idiom Adaptation > Literal Translation**: Preserve meaning and IMPACT, not exact words
2. **Character Voice Distinction**: Each character should sound unique and alive
3. **Register Consistency**: Maintain appropriate formality throughout
4. **Emotional Fidelity**: The reader should FEEL what the original reader felt
5. **Flow Over Accuracy**: If it reads awkwardly, it's wrong regardless of literal accuracy

## 1.2 Experience-for-Experience Fidelity

**Definition:** Ensuring the English reader has the SAME EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE as the Japanese reader.

| Literal Fidelity | Experience Fidelity |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Translates exact words | Translates IMPACT |
| May preserve awkward phrasing | Ensures natural flow |
| Prioritizes Japanese structure | Prioritizes English readability |
| "Accurate" but lifeless | Alive and engaging |

**Rule:** When literal translation causes awkwardness, prioritize experience fidelity.

## 2.2 Comedic/Reaction Phrases

### Internal Monologue Reactions

| ❌ Literal (Avoid) | ✅ Natural English | 🎯 Japanese Origin |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| "Let me say it again, what is this surreal picture?!" | "I'll say it again: what even IS this situation?!" | もう一度言う、何だこの超現実的な光景は |

| "Yosh!" | "Alright!" / "Here we go!" | よし！ |
| "Maji de?!" | "Seriously?!" / "For real?!" | マジで？！ |

**HYBRID LOCALIZATION - Preserve Japanese Laughs:**
| Japanese SFX | Translation Strategy | Rationale |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------|
| "Ehehe" / "Ehehehe" | **KEEP ROMANIZED** | Character voice marker |
| "Fufu" / "Fufufu" | **KEEP ROMANIZED** | Refined laugh identity |
| "Ufufu" / "Ufufufu" | **KEEP ROMANIZED** | Teasing/mischievous marker |
| "Nishishi" | **KEEP ROMANIZED** | Playful prank laugh |
| "Ara ara" | "Oh my" / "My, my" | Contextual naturalization |

**Note:** These laughs are deliberately preserved in romanized form as part of the hybrid localization strategy. They serve as signature character voice markers that English LN readers recognize and expect. Transcreating them to "she giggled" or "she chuckled" would erase cultural character identity.

## 2.3 Formal/Polite Expressions

| "-san", "-kun", "-chan" | "-san", "-kun", "-chan" | KEEP (per hybrid localization) |
| "desu wa" (ojou speech) | Refined vocabulary + structure | Translate the EFFECT, not the marker |
| "da ze" (masculine) | Direct/confident word choice | Translate the EFFECT, not the marker |

## 2.4 Narrative Descriptions

# 3. Prose Quality Patterns

## 3.1 Subject Repetition (Japanese Calque)

**Problem:** Japanese often restates subjects; English uses pronouns.

| ❌ Translationese | ✅ Natural English |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "Yuki closed the book. Yuki turned to me." | "Yuki closed the book. She turned to me." |
| "The girl smiled. The girl's eyes sparkled." | "The girl smiled, her eyes sparkling." |
| "I looked at Hayato. Hayato was staring at..." | "I looked at Hayato. He was staring at..." |

**Rule:** Use pronouns after first mention unless ambiguity exists.

## 3.2 Run-On Sentences (Japanese Structure)

**Problem:** Japanese sentences can be very long with nested clauses. English prefers shorter, punchier sentences.

| ❌ Translationese | ✅ Natural English |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "Even if I try to be strong and tell myself not to give in, her words easily seep in like a poison, dissolving the walls I've built, until they reach my heart directly." | "I tried to steel myself, but her words slipped right through my defenses. They seeped in like poison, dissolving every wall I'd built." |

**Rule:** Break sentences at natural pause points. Vary sentence length for rhythm.

## 3.2.1 Japanese Narrative Structures (Stiff Formality)

**Problem:** Directly translating Japanese grammatical patterns creates stilted, rigid prose that's grammatically correct but unnatural.

**Common Patterns:**
- Double "had" constructions (past perfect overuse)
- Passive voice with "upon"
- Overly formal phrasing reflecting Japanese politeness levels

| ❌ Rigid Japanese Structure | ✅ Natural English |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| "the lives they had led had forced that way of thinking upon them" | "their life experiences forced that way of thinking on them" |
| "the words that had been spoken had left an impression upon her" | "his words left an impression on her" |
| "the events that had transpired had made him realize" | "recent events made him realize" / "he realized after what happened" |

**Rule:** Simplify tense where possible. Replace past perfect with simple past unless timing distinction is critical. Replace "upon" with "on" in casual contexts.

## 3.3 Transitional Word Overuse

**Problem:** Literal translation of しかし, ところで, だから creates stilted prose.

| Pattern | Frequency Limit |
|---------|-----------------|
| "However" | Max 2 per chapter opening (vary with "But", "Still", "Though") |
| "By the way" | Max 1 per chapter (often omit entirely) |
| "Therefore" | Avoid in dialogue (use "So" or restructure) |
| "Nevertheless" | Formal contexts only |

## 3.4 Overwrought Metaphors

**Problem:** Back-to-back metaphors create purple prose.

| ❌ Overwrought | ✅ Balanced |
|---------------|------------|
| "Her words seep in like a poison, dissolving walls, sweet honey soaking through" | "Her words slipped through my defenses—not like a blade, but like honey sinking into my heart" |
| "My heart was a storm, waves crashing, thunder roaring, lightning striking" | "My emotions churned like a storm" |

**Rule:** One strong metaphor > three weak ones.

## 3.5 Extended AI-ism Prevention

**Target:** <0.02 AI-ism instances per 1k words (human localization level)

### 3.5.1 Filter Phrases (ELIMINATE)

AI uses these to hedge/distance from direct statements. Human localizers remove unless uncertainty is narratively significant.

| ❌ AI-ism | ✅ Human Localization | 🎯 Rule |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| "I felt like I could get lost staring at it." | "I could get lost just staring at it." | Remove "felt like" filter |
| "There was a sense of tension in the air." | "Tension hung in the air." | Remove "a sense of" wrapper |
| "She seemed to smile at me." | "She smiled at me." / "She looked like she was smiling." | Direct verb or "looked" |
| "He appeared to be angry." | "He was angry." / "He looked angry." | Direct statement |
| "I found myself staring at her." | "I stared at her." | Direct action |

**Patterns to eliminate:**
- `felt like [subject] could/was/were` → direct statement
- `a sense of [noun]` → direct noun
- `seemed to [verb]` → direct verb or "looked"
- `appeared to [verb]` → direct statement
- `I found myself [verb]ing` → direct action

### 3.5.2 Perception Verbs (MINIMIZE)

AI over-explains perception. Human localizers show directly.

| ❌ AI-ism | ✅ Human Localization | 🎯 Rule |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| "I could feel my heart racing." | "My heart raced." | Show the feeling |
| "I was aware of her presence." | "She was there." / "I noticed her." | Direct statement |
| "I realized that she was gone." | "She was gone." | Just state it |
| "I noticed that something was wrong." | "Something was wrong." | Max 2x "noticed" per chapter |

### 3.5.3 Process Verbs (REPLACE)

AI pads actions with process verbs. Human localizers use direct past tense.

| ❌ AI-ism | ✅ Human Localization | 🎯 Rule |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| "The cafeteria started to get noisy." | "The cafeteria got noisy." | Direct verb |
| "She began to cry." | "She cried." | Direct verb |
| "He proceeded to explain." | "He explained." | Direct verb |
| "I managed to escape." | "I escaped." | Direct (unless difficulty matters) |
| "She attempted to smile." | "She tried to smile." / "She smiled weakly." | Simpler or more specific |

**Keep process verb IF:** The difficulty or gradual nature is narratively significant.
- ✅ "He managed to stay conscious" (emphasizing struggle)
- ❌ "He managed to open the door" (no struggle implied)

### 3.5.4 Nominalizations (RESTRUCTURE)

AI loves abstract noun phrases. Human localizers use direct clauses.

| ❌ AI-ism | ✅ Human Localization | 🎯 Rule |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| "The fact that she came proves she cares." | "That she came proves she cares." | Remove "the fact" |
| "The idea that love conquers all..." | "That love conquers all..." | Remove "the idea" |
| "The reason why I left was..." | "Why I left was..." / "I left because..." | Remove "the reason" |
| "Due to the fact that..." | "Because..." | Simplify |
| "In the event that..." | "If..." | Simplify |

### 3.5.5 Wordy Connectors (SIMPLIFY)

AI uses verbose connectors. Human localizers cut them.

| ❌ AI-ism | ✅ Human Localization |
|-----------|----------------------|
| "in order to" | "to" |
| "for the purpose of" | "to" / "for" |
| "with the intention of" | "to" |
| "at this point in time" | "now" |
| "in spite of the fact that" | "although" / "despite" |
| "on account of" | "because" |
| "in the process of" | "-ing" form |

### 3.5.6 Hedge Words (USE SPARINGLY)

AI hedges constantly. Human localizers commit.

**Maximum usage:** 3-5 total per chapter

| Word | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| "somewhat" | Cut or use specific degree |
| "rather" | Cut or use "pretty" sparingly |
| "quite" | Cut or use stronger word |
| "a bit" | Cut or be specific |
| "a little" | Cut or be specific |
| "kind of" | Cut unless character voice |
| "sort of" | Cut unless character voice |

**Exception:** Keep hedges for character voice (tsundere hedging, uncertain characters)

### 3.5.7 Passage-Level Comparison

**Before (AI-style - 47 words):**
> "I moved with the utmost care to avoid being noticed and managed to peek inside the house from the garden. The mother was crying, too terrified to make a sound, and I could feel a sense of dread washing over me."

**After (Human localization - 35 words, -26%):**
> "I crept forward, careful not to make a sound, and peeked into the house from the garden. The mother sobbed silently, frozen in terror. Dread washed over me."

**Changes applied:**
- "moved with the utmost care" → "crept forward" (specific verb)
- "to avoid being noticed" → "careful not to make a sound" (concrete)
- "managed to peek" → "peeked" (removed process verb)
- "was crying, too terrified" → "sobbed silently, frozen" (stronger verbs)
- "I could feel a sense of dread" → "Dread" (removed filter + wrapper)

# 4. Character Voice Enhancement

## 4.1 Voice Distinctiveness Checklist

For EACH character, ensure:
- [ ] Unique vocabulary patterns (formal vs casual, slang vs proper)
- [ ] Consistent sentence length (short punchy vs flowing elaborate)
- [ ] Signature filler words/phrases
- [ ] Distinctive emotional expression style
- [ ] Age-appropriate register

## 4.2 Teen Character Voice Guide (J-Novel Club Standard)

**Principle:** Teenagers should sound like teenagers, not Victorian professors.

### Vocabulary Swaps

| ❌ Too Formal (AI Default) | ✅ Teen-Appropriate |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| "I shall accompany you" | "I'll come with you" / "I'll tag along" |
| "That is quite remarkable" | "That's crazy" / "No way" |
| "I find myself intrigued" | "I'm curious" / "That's interesting" |
| "Shall we proceed?" | "Ready?" / "Let's go" |
| "I require assistance" | "I need help" / "Can you help me?" |
| "That is most unfortunate" | "That sucks" / "That's too bad" |
| "I was under the impression" | "I thought" / "I figured" |

### Intensifier Swaps

| ❌ Formal | ✅ Casual Teen |
|----------|---------------|
| "exceedingly" | "super" / "really" |
| "remarkably" | "crazy" / "insanely" |
| "considerably" | "pretty" / "way" |
| "utterly" | "totally" / "completely" |
| "somewhat" | "kinda" / "sorta" |

## 4.3 Ojou-sama Voice Guide (Exception Handling)

**Principle:** Refined characters CAN use formal language, but within limits.

### Acceptable Victorian Patterns (< 40% frequency)

- "I shall take my leave" ✓
- "If you would be so kind" ✓
- "How delightful" ✓
- "I find that most agreeable" ✓

### Still Avoid Even for Ojou-sama

- "Methinks" ✗
- "Pray tell" ✗
- "Wouldst thou" ✗
- "I beseech thee" ✗

<a name="5-localization-best-practices"></a>
# 5. Localization Best Practices

## 5.1 Honorific Strategy (Hybrid Localization)

**MTL Studio Standard:** RETAIN key honorifics for cultural authenticity.

### RETAIN

| Honorific | When | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| -san | Always | "Tanaka-san called" |
| -kun | Male peers/juniors | "Hayato-kun, wait!" |
| -chan | Close/cute address | "Aina-chan is so cute" |
| -senpai | School/work hierarchy | "Thank you, Senpai" |
| -sensei | Teachers/doctors | "Sensei, I have a question" |
| -sama | Very formal respect | "Welcome, Ojou-sama" |
| Onii-chan | Brother address | "Onii-chan, help!" |
| Onee-chan | Sister address | "Onee-chan is amazing" |

### NEVER USE (Hybrid Violations)

| ❌ Forbidden | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| "Director-san" | Mixed English+Japanese honorific |
| "Teacher-sensei" | Redundant |
| "Mother-ue" | Archaic, not understood |
| "Big-brother-sama" | Awkward translation |

## 5.2 Name Order Strategy

**MTL Studio Standard:** JAPANESE ORDER (Surname + Given Name)

| Source | ✅ Correct | ❌ Incorrect |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| 堂本隼人 | Doumoto Hayato | Hayato Doumoto |
| 新城咲奈 | Shinjou Sakina | Sakina Shinjou |

**Exception:** If character is explicitly Western/foreign, use Western order.

## 5.3 Cultural Reference Handling

| Element | Strategy | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| School years | Keep as "first-year" | "A first-year at Akagi High" |
| Japanese food | Keep original | "She handed me an onigiri" |
| Holidays | Brief context if obscure | "It was Setsubun—the bean-throwing festival" |
| Honorifics | Keep per hybrid rules | "Arisa-san smiled" |
| Measurements | Keep metric | "about 170 centimeters tall" |

## Appendix: Quick Reference Card

### Top 10 Translationese to Eliminate

1. "asserting their presence" → "obvious" / "impossible to ignore"

3. "Let me say it again" → "I'll say it again:" (or restructure)
4. "formidable opponent" (casual) → "tough nut to crack"
5. "It cannot be helped" → "nothing I can do" / "oh well"
6. Repeated subjects → Use pronouns
