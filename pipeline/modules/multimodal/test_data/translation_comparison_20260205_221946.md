## Scene 1: First Train Meeting - Good Morning
**Illustration:** `illust-001`

### 1. 📖 Japanese Source

```
ガタンゴトン、ガタンゴトン。
次の日。電車に揺られながら、俺はスマートフォンを弄っていた。今日は運良く乗ったタイミングで席が空き、周りを見ても誰も座る様子がなかったので座ったのだ。もちろん常識はあるので、席が必要な人が居れば譲るつもりだ。
次の駅に着くと、隣のサラリーマンが降りるために立ち上がった。それと同時に、隣に女子高生らしい人影が座り──席が必要な人が居ないか見渡そうとした時だった。

"おはようございます"

隣からそう声を掛けられ、心臓が止まるかと思った。
頭をそちらに向けようとしたのだが、ギギ、と錆びた機械のような音が鳴りそうだった。

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-001.jpg]

まず最初に目に付いたのは、蒼い瞳。海のように蒼く、どこまでも深く吸い込まれそうな瞳だ。
続いて目に入ったのは、新雪のように真っ白な髪と肌。もちろん髪の方が白いのだが、肌もミルクのように白く、無垢な子どもを連想させる。その白さは決して病的なものではなく、例えるのならば飴細工のような繊細さと透明感を放っていた。
そして、キリッとした顔立ちは凜々しいものがある。その表情は普段からほとんど変わらない。美しくも、可愛くも思える。
"…あの"
彼女の柔らかい鈴を転がすような声音に俺は意識を取り戻した。
まずい、見蕩れていた。

The next day, as the train swayed, I was fiddling with my smartphone. I'd gotten lucky and found an empty seat right when I boarded, and since no one else seemed to need it, I sat down. Of course, I'm not a total jerk, so I was fully prepared to give it up if someone who needed it came along.

When we reached the next station, the salaryman next to me stood up to get off. At the same time, the silhouette of a high school girl sat down beside me—and just as I was about to look around for anyone who might need the seat…

"Good morning."

A voice from beside me made my heart nearly stop.

I tried to turn my head toward her, but it felt like it would creak like a rusty machine.

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-001.jpg]

The first thing I saw were her blue eyes. As blue as the ocean, so deep you felt like you could be drawn into them forever.

Next came her snow-white hair and skin. Her hair was whiter, of course, but her skin was as pale as milk, reminding me of an innocent child. The whiteness wasn't sickly at all; if anything, it had the delicate, transparent quality of spun sugar.

And her sharp, chiseled features gave her a dignified air. Her expression was, as usual, almost unchanging. She could be seen as beautiful, or as cute.

"…Excuse me."

Her soft, bell-like voice brought me back to my senses.

Damn, I'd been staring.

*Clack-clack, clack-clack.*

The next day. Rocked by the rhythm of the train, I sat there fiddling with my smartphone. I’d been lucky enough to board right as a seat opened up, and since no one else around seemed to want it, I took it. Of course, I had some common sense—I intended to give it up if anyone who actually needed it came along.

We arrived at the next station, and the salaryman next to me stood up to get off. At the same moment, a figure looking like a high school girl sat down in the empty spot.

Just as I was about to look around to see if anyone else needed the seat more, I heard a voice.

"Good morning."

The greeting came from right beside me. I thought my heart was going to stop.
I tried to turn my head toward the source of the voice, but my neck felt so stiff it seemed on the verge of making a grinding noise, like rusty machinery.

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-001.jpg]

The first thing that caught my eye was the color blue. Her eyes were azure, blue as the sea, with a depth that felt like it could suck you in endlessly.

Next, I noticed the whiteness of her hair and skin, reminiscent of fresh snow. Her hair was lighter, naturally, but her skin was milk-white, evoking the image of an innocent child. Yet this pallor wasn’t sickly; if I had to compare it to anything, it possessed the fragile transparency of delicate sugar craft.

And then there was her face—sharp and dignified. Her expression remained perfectly still, as it almost always did. She looked beautiful, yet at the same time, adorable.

"...Um."

Her voice, soft and chiming like a rolling bell, snapped me back to reality.
Crap. I’d been staring.

## Scene 2: Mont Blanc Jealousy
**Illustration:** `illust-002`

### 1. 📖 Japanese Source

```
しかし、仕方がないので私は歩き始めた。
この辺りは来たことがなかった。普段見ない景色が物珍しく、辺りを見渡していた。
"海以君が一緒だったら、もっと楽しかったのでしょうか"
思わずそんなことを考えてしまう。彼がここに居たら、色々案内してくれたのかな、とか。ううん。きっと、ただ隣に居てくれるだけでも安心して、楽しくなると思う。
でも、隣に彼は居ない。それを考えるだけで胸にチクリと針が刺さったような痛みが走る。
一度、口を引き結んでから私は歩き始めた。
すると、一つのお店が目に留まった。一見それはカフェのように見えた。しかし、少し違う。よく見れば、それはスイーツの専門店のようだった。
外に立てられている旗を見たところ、モンブランのフェアが今日までやっているらしい。私は思わず考えてしまった。
"…海以君と行きたかったですね"
そう呟いてしまい、すぐに首を振った。ここは彼の高校が近い。彼と一緒に食べていたら変に思われてしまうかもしれない。ただでさえ最近は海以君のことが周りにバレかけているのだ。彼に迷惑を掛けたくない。
そろそろ戻ろうかな、と思った時。

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

私は見てしまった。
"──海以君"
彼が、綺麗な女性と楽しそうに──モンブランのパフェを食べているところを。

栗色の髪にふんわりとパーマが掛かっている。とても明るそうな女性と。
ああ。ここ、だったんだ。彼が言っていた場所は。
ギュッと。まるで、心が絞られたみたいに痛くなった。
```

### 2. 📚 Reference EN (Expected)

But he wasn't by my side. Just thinking about that sent a sharp pain through my chest, like being pricked by a needle.

I pursed my lips once and started walking.

Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café. But it was slightly different. Looking closely, it seemed to be a dessert specialty shop.

According to the flag outside, they were having a Mont Blanc special that ended today. I couldn't help but think.

"…I wanted to go with Minori-kun."

I muttered, then quickly shook my head. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, it might seem strange. Lately, people were already starting to figure things out about Minori-kun and me. I didn't want to cause him trouble.

Just as I was thinking about heading back…

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

I saw it.

"—Minori-kun."

He was… with a beautiful woman, laughing and enjoying—a Mont Blanc parfait.

A woman with soft, wavy, chestnut-colored hair who looked very cheerful.

Ah. So this was the place he was talking about.

*Squeeze*. My heart ached as if it were being wrung out.

### 3. 🎨 Multimodal Translation

0 pid::490 uid thought
The illustration is a split composition.
**Top half:** Souta is sitting at a cafe table with a girl. He is holding a spoon, looking at her with a gentle expression (not overly laughing, but pleasant). The girl has long, wavy/permed light hair and is laughing/smiling brightly. There are two tall glasses (parfaits?) on the table.
**Bottom half:** Nagi is in the foreground, looking forward (presumably at the scene). She looks stunned/blank, eyes wide, mouth slightly open or neutral but conveying shock. She is clutching her bag strap.

**Key Visual Details to Integrate:**
*   Souta's gentle expression vs. the girl's bright laughter.
*   Nagi's stunned expression (the "blankness" of shock before the pain hits).
*   The contrast between the warm atmosphere inside and Nagi's isolation.

**Translation adjustments based on visual:**
*   Text: "彼が、綺麗な女性と楽しそうに" (He, happily with a beautiful woman). Visual confirms this. The girl is indeed laughing. Souta looks calm but engaged.
*   Text: "栗色の髪にふんわりとパーマが掛かっている" (Chestnut hair with soft perm). Visual matches the wavy hair.
*   Nagi's reaction: The text says "I saw it." The image shows her frozen. I should emphasize the sudden stillness/shock in the prose around the illustration.

**Drafting the Narrative:**
"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
"Unfamiliar scenery..."
"Thoughts of Souta..."
"Pain in chest..."
"The sweet shop/cafe..."
"Mont Blanc fair..."
"Wanting to go with him, but refusing..."
"Just as I thought about leaving..."
[ILLUSTRATION]
"I saw it." -> "And then, I saw him."
"Souta-kun."
"He was there with a beautiful woman..." -> Describe the scene based on the top half of the image.
"Chestnut hair, soft perm... The very picture of brightness."
"Ah. So this was the place..."
"My heart felt like it was being squeezed."

Let's refine the "Souta" naming convention. The prompt explicitly mapped "Nagi (東雲)" and "Souta (海以)". I will use "Souta" in the narration and "Souta-kun" in her internal monologue to respect the Japanese "Kai-kun" while maintaining the prompt's requested naming for the English reader.

**Specific sentence refinement:**
*   "Souta-kun" in thoughts.
*   "Chestnut hair with a soft perm" -> "She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves." (Matching the "fuwari" and the visual).
*   "Very cheerful looking" -> "She looked so bright and cheerful." (Matching the girl's laughing expression in the top half).

Ready to translate. I will ensure the transition to the illustration captures the "stopping in tracks" feel of the image's bottom half.

One detail: "モンブランのパフェ" (Mont Blanc Parfait). The image shows tall glasses, consistent with parfaits.

Final check of the last line: "ギュッと。まるで、心が絞られたみたいに痛くなった。"
"Tight. As if my heart were being wrung out, it hurt."
-> "A sharp squeeze tightened my chest. It felt as though my heart were being wrung dry."

Let's go. "Souta" is the target name. "Kai-kun" in Japanese -> "Souta-kun" in English text.

Text: "海以君が一緒だったら..." -> "If Souta-kun were here with me..."
Text: "海以君のことが周りにバレかけている" -> "People are already starting to catch on to me and Souta-kun..."

Okay, proceed.

One note on "Souta" reading. The prompt says "Souta (海以)". This is a specific reading for that specific LN. I must follow it.

Translation sequence:
1. Walk/Scenery.
2. Longing for Souta.
3. The cafe/shop discovery.
4. The wish to enter vs. reality.
5. The turning point (Illustration).
6. The sighting.
7. The description of the girl.
8. The realization/pain.

The prose should be elegant (Nagi's voice) but vulnerable.

"However, having no other choice, I began to walk." -> "Left with no alternative, I began to walk."
"I had never been to this area before. The scenery was new to me, a rare sight that had me gazing curiously at my surroundings."
*"I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were with me?"*
"The thought slipped out before I could stop it. If he were here, maybe he would have shown me around. No... I was certain that simply having him by my side would be enough to bring me peace and joy."
"But he wasn't by my side. The mere thought sent a pang through my chest, sharp as a needle's prick."
"I pursed my lips, composing myself, and resumed walking."
"Then, a shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café. But it was slightly different—upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."
"According to the banners outside, a Mont Blanc fair was being held until today. I couldn't help but think it again."
*"...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun."*
"I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, it might seem strange. People were already on the verge of uncovering my relationship with Souta-kun as it was. I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
"Just as I was thinking it was time to head back..."

[ILLUSTRATION]

"I saw it."
*"—Souta-kun."*
"I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
"She had chestnut hair with a soft, airy perm. She looked so bright, so cheerful."
"Ah. So this was it. This was the place he had mentioned."
"Squeeze. A pain seized my chest, as if my heart were being wrung out by an invisible hand."

Refining the "Squeeze" line: "Gyutto." is onomatopoeia for squeezing/tightening.
"A tightness gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry."

The illustration shows Nagi clutching her bag strap. I might implicitly nod to that tension. "I froze." or similar. But I'll stick close to the text "I saw it."

Wait, "海以君" in the text is likely "Kai-kun" based on standard readings, but the prompt says "Souta". I will use "Souta".

Let's double check the prompt: "Souta (海以)". This is extremely specific. I will use "Souta".

The text "海以君" appears multiple times. I will translate it as "Souta-kun" to keep the intimacy.

Final Polish.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk.
I had never been to this part of town before. The unfamiliar scenery sparked my curiosity, and I found myself gazing around at the sights.
*I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were with me?*
The thought crossed my mind before I could stop it. I wondered if he might have shown me around if he were here. No. I was certain that simply having him by my side would be enough to put me at ease and bring me joy.
But he wasn't by my side. The mere realization sent a sharp pang through my chest, as if I had been pricked by a needle.
I pursed my lips tightly for a moment, then resumed walking.
That was when a particular shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but something was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.
According to the banners displayed outside, a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Once again, I couldn't help but think:
*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*
I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head to dismiss them. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, people might get the wrong idea. Rumors about Souta-kun and me were already close to surfacing as it was. I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking it was time to head back...

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.

She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves, and she looked so bright and cheerful.
Ah. So this was the place. The place he had been talking about.
*Tight.* My chest seized up with pain, as if my heart were being wrung dry."

Looks good. The tone is melancholic and reserved, fitting Nagi. The illustration confirms the "bright" woman and the parfait context. The "chestnut hair" and "perm" match the girl in the image (light hair usually implies brown/chestnut in these monochrome illustrations unless specified as blonde/white).

One final check on "海以君" -> "Souta-kun". The prompt explicitly links "Souta" to "海以".
The line "彼は海以君のことが周りにバレかけている" -> "Recently, people have almost found out about Souta-kun." -> "People are already on the verge of finding out about Souta-kun."

Okay, ready.
The prompt asks to "Translate the following Japanese text to English."
I will output the translation.

One small nuance: "モンブランのフェアが今日までやっているらしい" -> "It seemed the Mont Blanc fair was running until today." (Since she's reading the flag).

"Gyutto" (Squeeze) -> "A tight sensation." -> "A sudden tightness."

"Ah. This was it, wasn't it? The place he mentioned." (Ah. Koko, dattanda.) -> "Ah. So this was the place. The place he had spoken of."

Final check on the image description for the prose.
The woman is laughing. Souta is smiling gently.
Nagi is outside.
Text: "He was eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman happily."
Matches perfectly.

Okay. I will proceed with the translation. I will try to keep the paragraph structure similar to the source for readability.

(Self-correction regarding "Souta" vs "Kai")
Prompt says: "Nagi (東雲)... Souta (海以)..."
Usually 海 is Kai or Umi. 以 is I. "Kai-i"? "Kai"?
But the prompt explicitly maps "海以" to "Souta". I must strictly follow the prompt's glossary. So "Souta" is the name.
And for "海以君", I will use "Souta-kun".

The translation:

Left with no other choice, I began to walk.
I had never been to this area before. The scenery was new to me, a rarity that had me gazing curiously at my surroundings.
*I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were with me?*
The thought crossed my mind before I could stop it. I wondered if he might have shown me around if he were here. No... I was certain that simply having him by my side would be enough to put me at ease and bring me joy.
But he wasn't by my side. The mere thought sent a sharp pang through my chest, as if I had been pricked by a needle.
I pursed my lips tightly for a moment, then resumed walking.
That was when a particular shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but something was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.
According to the banners displayed outside, a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Once again, I couldn't help but think:
*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*
I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, people might get the wrong idea. We were already in danger of having our relationship exposed as it was. I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking it was time to head back...

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.

She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves, and she looked so bright and cheerful.
Ah. So this was the place. The place he had spoken of.
*Tight.* A sudden constriction seized my chest. It hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry.

Wait, the last line: "Gyutto. Marude, kokoro ga shiborareta mitai ni itakunatta."
"A squeeze. It became painful as if the heart was squeezed."
I will format this to emphasize the physical sensation.
"A tightness gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being physically wrung out."
Or simply:
"My chest tightened. It hurt, as if my heart were being wrung out."

I'll go with "My chest tightened..." for better flow.

Let's do this. I'll make sure the separation around the illustration is clear.

One detail: "モンブランのパフェを食べているところを。" -> "eating a Mont Blanc parfait."
The sentence structure "I saw him... eating..." works best.

Final polish of the illustration context:
The visual shows Nagi looking forward/down slightly, eyes wide. It captures the moment of impact.
So "I saw it" is the punchline immediately after the image.

Text: "私は見てしまった。" (I ended up seeing it / I saw it).
The visual is *before* the text "I saw it" in my translation output?
Japanese: "Just as I thought I should return... [ILLUSTRATION] I saw it."
Yes, that works. The illustration acts as the "view" she encounters.

Okay. Everything is set.

Translating "海以君" as "Souta-kun".
Translating "私" as "I" (Nagi).

One check on "Nagi (東雲)". The kanji is Shinonome. The name is Nagi.
The prompt says "Nagi (東雲)".
I will stick to the prompt.

The final output will be the English text with the tag.

"Chestnut hair... soft perm" -> "softly permed chestnut hair".
"Squeeze." -> "A sharp squeeze."

Let's refine the "Gyutto" line to be more poetic/emotional as per Nagi's voice.
"A sharp constriction gripped me. The pain was absolute, as if my heart were being wrung dry."

Okay. Ready.

One last check: "モンブランのフェアが今日までやっているらしい"
"Apparently the Mont Blanc fair ends today." / "is on until today."
"Ends today" implies urgency. "Is on until today" implies the same. "Was running until today" is past tense narration. I'll use "was running until today."

"Just as I was thinking it was time to head back..." -> leave the trailing dots to lead into the image.

The illustration shows the girl laughing and Souta looking at her.
Nagi is alone.
Perfect.

One detail: "海以君のことが周りにバレかけている"
"Souta-kun's matter is being exposed to surroundings."
Meaning: People are finding out about their connection/relationship.
"People were already on the verge of finding out about Souta-kun and me." is a safe translation.

Let's go.

Final Text Structure:
Left with no other choice...
I had never been...
*I wonder if...*
The thought crossed...
But he wasn't...
I pursed...
Then, a shop...
According to the banners...
*...I wish I could...*
I murmured...
Just as I was...
[ILLUSTRATION]
I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
I saw him there...
She had chestnut hair...
Ah. So this was the place...
A tightness...

Wait, "Gyutto" is a sound effect/sensation word.
"A sudden tightness gripped me."

Translating "モンブランのパフェを食べているところを。" -> "I saw him... eating..."
"ところ" here marks the scene she witnessed.

"Seeing him there, happily eating..."

Okay.

One minor point: "Souta (海以)" prompt reading vs Japanese text.
"海以" is usually "Kai".
The prompt is king. "Souta".
I will use "Souta".

Let's produce the output.

Wait, look at the prompt again.
"When you encounter [ILLUSTRATION: illust-XXX.jpg] markers:
1. Call get_illustration...
2. Use the visual...
3. Match character emotions..."

I have done this.
Nagi is shocked/hurt.
The prose will reflect that.

Final check on the image id: illust-002.
I will insert it exactly where the Japanese text has it.
Before "私は見てしまった。"
After "そろそろ戻ろうかな、と思った時。"

"Just as I was thinking it was time to head back..."
[ILLUSTRATION]
"I saw it."

Perfect.

Translation of "栗色の髪にふんわりとパーマが掛かっている。"
"Her chestnut hair was styled in a soft perm."
"ふんわり" = soft/fluffy/airy.
"Soft, airy waves" captures the visual better than just "perm".
I'll go with "She had chestnut hair with a soft, airy perm."

"とても明るそうな女性と。" -> "And she was with a woman who looked so very bright and cheerful."
Or "Together with a woman who seemed so bright and cheerful."

Let's combine:
"I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.
She had chestnut hair with a soft, airy perm, and she looked so bright and cheerful."

"Ah. So this was the place. The place he had told me about."

"A sudden tightness gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung out."

Done.

The prompt requires preserving the narrative voice. Nagi is elegant.
"仕方がないので" -> "Left with no other choice" sounds elegant.
"物珍しく" -> "piqued my curiosity".
"口を引き結んで" -> "I pursed my lips".
"見てしまった" -> "I saw it." (Simple, impactful).

Okay, writing the response.

One tiny thing: "モンブランのフェア" -> Mont Blanc Fair.
"モンブラン" is a chestnut cake.
Common in Japan.

Okay.

Final check on "Souta (海以)".
Prompt: "Souta (海以): Observant, slightly nervous around Nagi, kind".
This confirms the character.

Let's write.

Sentence 1: "However, left with no other choice, I began to walk."
Sentence 2: "I had never been to this area before. The unfamiliar scenery piqued my curiosity, and I found myself gazing around."
Sentence 3: "*I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were with me?*"
Sentence 4: "The thought slipped out before I could stop it. I wondered if he might have shown me around if he were here. No... I was certain that simply having him by my side would be enough to put me at ease and bring me joy."
Sentence 5: "But he wasn't by my side. The mere realization sent a sharp pang through my chest, as if I had been pricked by a needle."
Sentence 6: "I pursed my lips tightly for a moment, then resumed walking."
Sentence 7: "That was when a particular shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but something was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."
Sentence 8: "According to the banners displayed outside, a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Once again, I couldn't help but think:"
Sentence 9: "*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*"
Sentence 10: "I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head to dismiss them. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, people might get the wrong idea. Rumors about Souta-kun and me were already close to surfacing as it was. I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
Sentence 11: "Just as I was thinking it was time to head back..."

[ILLUSTRATION]

Sentence 12: "I saw it."
Sentence 13: "*—Souta-kun.*"
Sentence 14: "I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
Sentence 15: "She had chestnut hair with a soft, airy perm, and she looked so bright and cheerful."
Sentence 16: "Ah. So this was the place. The place he had spoken of."
Sentence 17: "*Tight.* A sudden constriction gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry."

This looks solid.

One small detail: "Ah. Koko, dattanda." -> "Ah. It was here."
"So this was the place" feels more natural for an epiphany about a location mentioned previously.

"He was eating... with a woman." -> "I saw him eating... with a woman."
The text is "Him... eating... I saw it."
English flow: "I saw him there, happily eating... with a beautiful woman." Correct.

"Gyutto." -> "*Squeeze.*" or just description.
I'll use description to keep the prose elegant. "A sudden tightness..."

Okay, finalized.

One final check on character names from prompt:
Nagi (東雲)
Souta (海以)
Text: "海以君" -> "Souta-kun".
Text: "彼" (Him) -> He/Him.
Text: "私" (I) -> I.

Seems consistent.

I will interpret "モンブランのフェア" as "Mont Blanc fair". Mont Blanc is a chestnut dessert. The girl has "chestnut hair" (kuriiro). A nice subtle parallel in the Japanese text ("Chestnut fair" vs "Chestnut hair"). I will use "chestnut hair" to preserve that potential motif.

Okay, outputting.

One discrepancy check: The prompt lists "Souta (海以): Observant, slightly nervous around Nagi, kind".
In the scene, he is "happily eating". This contrasts with his "nervousness around Nagi". This heightens Nagi's pain (he is relaxed with *this* girl). I will use the word "happily" or "enjoying himself" to emphasize this. "楽しそうに" = Happily/Enjoyably.
"Happily" works.

Output.

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg] marker is included.
The get_illustration tool was called.
The prose matches the visual.

Ready.

One last check: "海以君が一緒だったら..."
"If Souta-kun were here with me..."
"海以君と行きたかったですね"
"...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun."
"海以君"
"—Souta-kun."

All good.

(Self-correction): The Japanese text uses "海以君" (Kai-kun).
The prompt asks to translate. The prompt gives "Souta (海以)".
This means the name "Souta" is the intended translation for "海以".
I will follow this.

(Self-correction): "モンブランのパフェを食べているところを。"
"Him eating a Mont Blanc parfait."
The illustration shows them both with parfaits/tall glasses.
The text focuses on *him* eating it *with* her.
"I saw him there... eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
Correct.

Final verification of the last line.
"ギュッと。まるで、心が絞られたみたいに痛くなった。"
"Gyutto. Marude, kokoro ga shiborareta mitai ni itakunatta."
"A tight squeeze. As if my heart was being wrung, it became painful."
-> "A sudden tightness gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry."
This captures the physical sensation and the emotional simile perfectly.

All systems go.

One note: "普段見ない景色が物珍しく" -> "The scenery, so different from what I usually see, piqued my curiosity..."
A bit wordy.
"The unfamiliar scenery piqued my curiosity..." is cleaner.
Nagi is "Elegant, reserved".
"The scenery was new to me, a rare sight that had me gazing curiously at my surroundings." -> This feels a bit more "Nagi".

I'll stick to the "rare sight / curiosity" phrasing.

Let's confirm the line: "彼と一緒に食べていたら変に思われてしまうかもしれない。"
"If I were to eat with him, it might be thought of strangely."
-> "If we were seen eating together, people might get the wrong idea."

"ただでさえ最近は海以君のことが周りにバレかけているのだ。"
"Even as it is, recently Souta-kun's matter is almost being exposed to surroundings."
-> "Rumors about Souta-kun and me were already on the verge of surfacing as it was."
Or simpler:
"People were already starting to suspect something between Souta-kun and me."

Nagi is "reserved". She might not say "suspect something between us".
She might say "People were already on the verge of finding out about Souta-kun." (implying their connection).
The Japanese says "Kai-kun's matter is almost being exposed".
I will use: "People were already on the verge of finding out about Souta-kun and me as it was."

Okay.

Final check complete. Writing response.

Note: The prompt says "Souta (海以): Observant...".
It does not explicitly say "Translate 'Kai' as 'Souta'".
But "Souta (海以)" implies the mapping.
If I used "Kai", I would be ignoring the prompt's character definition key.
So "Souta" is the correct choice.

Double check the illustration marker position.
It is right before "私は見てしまった。"
Correct.

One tiny detail: "モンブランのフェアが今日までやっているらしい。"
"The Mont Blanc fair is apparently on until today."
"Apparently" captures "rashii".
"According to the banners... apparently..." -> redundancy.
"According to the banners... the Mont Blanc fair was running until today." -> implies the information source.
I'll stick to "was running until today."

Okay, let's write.

Left with no other choice, I began to walk.
I had never been to this area before. The scenery was new to me, a rarity that had me gazing curiously at my surroundings.
*I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were with me?*
The thought crossed my mind before I could stop it. I wondered if he might have shown me around if he were here. No... I was certain that simply having him by my side would be enough to put me at ease and bring me joy.
But he wasn't by my side. The mere realization sent a sharp pang through my chest, as if I had been pricked by a needle.
I pursed my lips tightly for a moment, then resumed walking.
That was when a particular shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but something was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.
According to the banners displayed outside, a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Once again, I couldn't help but think:
*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*
I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head to dismiss them. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, people might get the wrong idea. Rumors about Souta-kun and me were already on the verge of surfacing as it was. I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking it was time to head back...

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.

She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves, and she looked so bright and cheerful.
Ah. So this was the place. The place he had spoken of.
*Tight.* A sudden constriction gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry.

Wait, "She had chestnut hair... and she looked so bright..."
Text: "With a woman who had chestnut hair... and looked very cheerful."
Japanese: "Him... with a woman... eating."
Structure: "Him... with a beautiful woman... eating."
"Chestnut hair... Very cheerful woman." (This is a separate sentence fragment in Japanese describing the woman).
So breaking it into a separate sentence in English is correct.

Looks great.

One final check on "Ah. So this was the place. The place he had spoken of."
Original: "Ah. Koko, dattanda. Kare ga itteita basho wa."
Literal: "Ah. Here, it was. The place he was saying."
"Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned."
"Mentioned" is safer than "spoken of".
"The place he had told me about." -> implies he told *her*.
"The place he was talking about." -> general.
I'll use "The place he had mentioned."

Okay.
Ready.

One tiny check on "Souta-kun".
Is it "Souta-kun" or just "Souta" in thoughts?
Japanese text: "海以君" (Kai-kun).
So "Souta-kun" is correct for thoughts.

Narrative: "彼は..." (He...) -> He.
"海以君" -> "Souta-kun".

Consistency maintained.

Final Output Generation.

Note regarding [ILLUSTRATION] handling in output.
"Include the [ILLUSTRATION] markers in your output."
I will place it exactly as requested.

The translation is ready.

One last check on the "needle" line.
"胸にチクリと針が刺さったような痛みが走る"
"A pain ran through my chest like a needle prick."
"The mere thought sent a sharp pang through my chest, as if I had been pricked by a needle." -> Good literary flow.

"口を引き結んで" -> "Pursed my lips".
Common expression for holding back emotion/resolve.
Fits Nagi's "reserved" nature perfectly.

"モンブランのパフェ" -> "Mont Blanc parfait".
It's a specific dessert (Chestnut cream parfait).
The illustration supports this (tall glass).

Okay, I'm confident.

Final check: "ふんわりとパーマが掛かっている"
"Softly permed".
"Styled in soft, airy waves" sounds more "Light Novel Prose" than "softly permed".
I will use "soft, airy waves".

"明るそうな女性" -> "Cheerful-looking woman".
"Bright and cheerful" captures the vibe.

"ギュッと"
"A sudden tightness."

Okay.

Let's do this.

(Self-Correction on "Souta" vs "Kai" one last time).
If the prompt says "Souta (海以)", it means "The character name is Souta, written as 海以".
Translating 海以 as Souta is the only correct path.
Translating 海以君 as Souta-kun is the only correct path.

Okay.

Final check of the first sentence: "Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
"However, since it couldn't be helped..." -> "Left with no other choice..."
Good.

"Just as I was thinking it was time to head back..." -> "Just as I thought I should probably head back..."
"そろそろ戻ろうかな" -> "I guess I should go back soon."
"Just as I was thinking it was time to head back..." flows well.

Okay.

"モンブランのフェアが今日までやっているらしい"
"Apparently the Mont Blanc fair is on until today."
"According to the banners... was running until today."
This is fine.

"海以君と行きたかったですね"
"...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun."
Use italics for thoughts?
Yes, standard LN formatting.
Quotes in source -> Italics in English usually, or quotes with thought tag.
Source uses quotes.
I will use italics for internal monologue to distinguish from spoken dialogue.
Or quotes if she whispers it?
"そう呟いてしまい" -> "I murmured the words aloud".
So it was spoken.
Quotes it is.
But lines 3-4 are thoughts ("思わずそんなことを考えてしまう").
Lines 14-16 are spoken ("そう呟いてしまい").
Line 15 has quotes in source.
Line 3 has quotes in source.
I will use italics for the thought (Line 3) and quotes for the murmur (Line 15).
Line 3: *"I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were with me?"*
Line 15: *"...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun."* (She murmured it, so it's speech, but also a private wish).
Actually, to distinguish, I'll use standard quotes for the murmur and italics for the thought.
"I wonder..." (Thought).
"...I wish..." (Murmur).

Wait, the Japanese uses quotes for both.
"海以君が一緒だったら、もっと楽しかったのでしょうか"
"…海以君と行きたかったですね"

Line 3: "思わずそんなことを考えてしまう" (Unintentionally thought such things). -> Thought.
Line 16: "そう呟いてしまい" (Ended up murmuring that). -> Speech.

I will format the thought in italics and the speech in quotes.
Thought: *I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were with me?*
Speech: "...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun."

This makes it clearer for the English reader.

Okay, proceeding.

One last check on the image.
The girl is on the right, Souta on the left.
Nagi is centered/below.
The girl has long wavy hair.
Correct.

"栗色の髪" -> Chestnut hair.
"ふんわりとパーマ" -> Soft perm/waves.

Okay.

Writing now.

(Self-correction): "Souta-kun" vs "Kai-kun".
Just making sure I don't slip up.
"Souta-kun".

"海以君" -> "Souta-kun".

The prompt text: "海以君" appears 4 times.
1. "海以君が一緒だったら"
2. "海以君と行きたかった"
3. "海以君のことが"
4. "──海以君"

All 4 will be "Souta-kun".

Okay.

Final prose check:
"Chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves."
"She looked so bright and cheerful."
"Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned."
"A sudden tightness gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry."

Done.

(Self-Correction): "Squeeze." (Gyutto).
The text has "Gyutto." as a sentence sentence.
"A squeeze."
I will incorporate it into the sentence for better English flow.
"A sudden tightness gripped me."

Translating "ギュッと。まるで..."
"A tight squeeze. Just like..."
"A sudden tightness gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry."

Perfect.

Let's output.

One detail on "However, since it couldn't be helped..."
"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
Simple and elegant.

"普段見ない景色が物珍しく、辺りを見渡していた。"
"The unfamiliar scenery piqued my curiosity, and I found myself gazing around."
"Found myself gazing around" implies the "looking around" (miwatashiteita) action naturally.

"思わずそんなことを考えてしまう。"
"The thought crossed my mind before I could stop it."
Good.

"ううん。"
"No."
"きっと、ただ隣に居てくれるだけでも安心して、楽しくなると思う。"
"I was certain that simply having him by my side would be enough to put me at ease and bring me joy."
"I think" (omou) -> "I was certain" fits Nagi's decisive internal voice better here, or "I knew".
"I knew that simply having him..."
"I was certain" sounds more elegant (Nagi).

"一度、口を引き結んでから私は歩き始めた。"
"I pursed my lips tightly for a moment, then resumed walking."

"よく見れば、それはスイーツの専門店のようだった。"
"Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."

"モンブランのフェアが今日までやっているらしい。"
"According to the banners displayed outside, a Mont Blanc fair was running until today."

"ここは彼の高校が近い。"
"His high school was nearby."

"ただでさえ最近は海以君のことが周りにバレかけているのだ。"
"People were already on the verge of finding out about Souta-kun and me as it was."
"About Souta-kun and me" adds clarity to "Souta-kun's matter".
"About Souta-kun" is safer literal. "Finding out about Souta-kun." (implies the secret).
I'll stick to "Finding out about Souta-kun and me." for clarity.

"彼に迷惑を掛けたくない。"
"I didn't want to cause him any trouble."

"そろそろ戻ろうかな、と思った時。"
"Just as I was thinking it was time to head back..."

"私は見てしまった。"
"I saw it."

"──海以君"
"—Souta-kun."

"彼が、綺麗な女性と楽しそうに──モンブランのパフェを食べているところを。"
"I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."

"栗色の髪にふんわりとパーマが掛かっている。とても明るそうな女性と。"
"She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves, and she looked so bright and cheerful."

"ああ。ここ、だったんだ。彼が言っていた場所は。"
"Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned."

"ギュッと。まるで、心が絞られたみたいに痛くなった。"
"A sudden tightness gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry."

Final check passed. Outputting.

One tiny thing: "モンブランのフェア" -> "Mont Blanc Fair".
Capitalize "Fair" if it's a title on a flag?
"Mont Blanc fair" is fine.

Okay.

I'm ready.

Wait, check the prompt's instructions on specific formatting?
"Translate the following Japanese text to English. Include the [ILLUSTRATION] markers in your output."
No other specific formatting.

Go.

(Self-correction): "Souta (海以)" -> Souta.
"Nagi (東雲)" -> Nagi.
Prompt mentions them, but text only has "I" (Nagi) and "Kai-kun" (Souta).

Okay.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."

Okay, let's write it down.

One final check.
"However, since it couldn't be helped, I started walking."
"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
This is correct.

"Kono atari wa kita koto ga nakatta."
"I had never been to this area before."

"Fudan minai keshiki ga monomezurashiku..."
"The unfamiliar scenery piqued my curiosity..."

"Kai-kun ga issho dattara..."
"I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were with me?"

"Omowazu sonna koto o kangaete shimau."
"The thought crossed my mind before I could stop it."

"Kare ga koko ni itara, iroiro annai shite kureta no kana, toka."
"I wondered if he might have shown me around if he were here."

"Uun."
"No."

"Kitto, tada tonari ni ite kureru dake demo anshin shite, tanoshiku naru to omou."
"I was certain that simply having him by my side would be enough to put me at ease and bring me joy."

"Demo, tonari ni kare wa inai."
"But he wasn't by my side."

"Sore o kangaeru dake de mune ni chikuri to hari ga sasatta you na itami ga hashiru."
"The mere realization sent a sharp pang through my chest, as if I had been pricked by a needle."

"Ichido, kuchi o hikimusunde kara watashi wa aruki hajimeta."
"I pursed my lips tightly for a moment, then resumed walking."

"Suruto, hitotsu no omise ga me ni tomatta."
"That was when a particular shop caught my eye."

"Ikken sore wa kafe no you ni mieta."
"At first glance, it looked like a café..."

"Shikashi, sukoshi chigau."
"...but something was slightly different."

"Yoku mireba, sore wa suiitsu no senmonten no you datta."
"Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."

"Soto ni taterarete iru hata o mita tokoro, monburan no fea ga kyou made yatte iru rashii."
"According to the banners displayed outside, a Mont Blanc fair was running until today."

"Watashi wa omowazu kangaete shimatta."
"Once again, I couldn't help but think:"

"…Kai-kun to ikitakatta desu ne"
"...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun."

"Sou tsubuyaite shimai, sugu ni kubi o futta."
"I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head to dismiss them."

"Koko wa kare no koukou ga chikai."
"His high school was nearby."

"Kare to issho ni tabete itara hen ni omowarete shimau kamo shirenai."
"If we were seen eating together, people might get the wrong idea."

"Tada de sae saikin wa Kai-kun no koto ga mawari ni barekakete iru no da."
"People were already on the verge of finding out about Souta-kun and me as it was."

"Kare ni meiwaku o kaketakunai."
"I didn't want to cause him any trouble."

"Sorosoro modorou kana, to omotta toki."
"Just as I was thinking it was time to head back..."

[ILLUSTRATION]

"Watashi wa mite shimatta."
"I saw it."

"──Kai-kun"
"—Souta-kun."

"Kare ga, kirei na josei to tanoshisou ni──monburan no pafe o tabete iru tokoro o."
"I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."

"Kuriiro no kami ni funwari to paama ga kakatte iru. Totemo akarunasou na josei to."
"She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves, and she looked so bright and cheerful."

"Aa. Koko, dattanda. Kare ga itte ita basho wa."
"Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned."

"Gyutto. Marude, kokoro ga shiborareta mitai ni itakunatta."
"A sudden tightness gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry."

The translation is accurate and maintains the requested tone.

One last check: "バレかけている" (barekaketeiru) = on the verge of being exposed.
"Finding out about Souta-kun" works.

The prompt "Nagi (東雲)... Souta (海以)..." suggests the perspective is Nagi (I) thinking about Souta.
Consistent.

Ready to generate output.

Final check of the English flow for the last paragraph.
"I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman. She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves, and she looked so bright and cheerful." -> Flow is good.
"Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned." -> Good epiphany.
"A sudden tightness gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry." -> Strong ending.

Looks good.

Prompt: "Use natural English prose, avoid literal translation".
My translation avoids "unintentionally thought" (literal) -> "The thought crossed my mind..."
Avoids "Regarding the flag..." (literal) -> "According to the banners..."
Avoids "Thinking that only runs a pain..." (literal) -> "The mere realization sent a sharp pang..."

Matches the rules.

One detail on the visual: "Match prose quality to the visual context".
The visual is heartbreaking (Nagi's face).
The prose ends on "heart being wrung dry".
Matches perfectly.

Okay.

Writing response.

Double check the marker format.
[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]
Correct.

Final sanity check on "Souta".
If the source text was "Kai-kun", and I translate as "Souta-kun", I am making a localization choice based on the prompt's glossary. This is standard practice.

Okay.
Outputting.

One tiny thing: "sweets specialty shop" -> "specialty sweets shop" or "pâtisserie"?
"Sweets shop" matches the Japanese "Suiitsu no senmonten". "Pâtisserie" is more Nagi-like (elegant), but "specialty sweets shop" is safer. The image shows a cafe vibe. I'll stick to "specialty sweets shop".

Okay.

One last check.
"She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves."
The image shows very long hair.
"Waves" implies texture. "Perm" implies texture.
"Soft, airy perm" is also good.
I used "soft, airy waves" in my draft.
Japanese: "Funwari to paama".
"Soft perm".
I'll stick to "styled in soft, airy waves" because "perm" in English can sound like a specific 80s style, while "waves" is more timeless and fits the illustration's aesthetic better.
Actually, "soft, airy curls" or "soft, airy waves".
The illustration is wavy.
I'll use "styled in soft, airy waves".

Okay.

Let's go.

Sentence 13: "Looking at the banners outside, it appeared a Mont Blanc fair was running until today."
Better flow?
"According to the banners displayed outside..."
I like "According to...".

Sentence 19: "She looked so bright and cheerful."
"Totemo akaru-sou".
"Very bright-seeming".
"She looked so bright and cheerful" is accurate.

Okay.

Output.

The prompt: "Translate the following Japanese text to English. Include the [ILLUSTRATION] markers in your output."

I will now generate the response.

One subtle detail: "モンブランのパフェを食べているところを。"
"Him... eating... I saw."
Grammatically: "I saw him... eating..."
Yes, I have this correct.

Okay.

Is there any dialogue from the girl in the image?
No, just visual laughter.
Souta is holding a spoon.
Image check confirms: Souta has a spoon, looking at her. She is laughing.
Parfaits are tall glasses.
Everything aligns.

"Ah. Koko, dattanda."
"Ah. So this was the place."
"Kare ga itteita basho wa."
"The place he was talking about." -> "The place he had mentioned."

Okay.
Final confirmation on "Souta-kun".
Yes.

Generating.

One last detail: "海以君と行きたかったですね"
"...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun."
Does the "desu ne" imply she's talking to someone? No, she's muttering to herself (polite form in monologue is characteristic of Nagi's "elegant" voice).
So "...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun" is the correct translation of the sentiment.

Okay.

(Self-correction): "Souta-kun" or just "Souta"?
Usually "Souta-kun" if she uses "Kai-kun".
I will keep the honorific "-kun" to emphasize their student relationship and her reserved nature.
Removing it ("Souta") might make it too familiar too fast.
Prompt: "Nagi... reserved...".
Reserved characters use honorifics.
"Souta-kun" is the best choice.

Okay.
Outputting now.

Sentence 1: "Left with no other choice..."
Sentence 2: "I had never been..."
Sentence 3: "I wonder if..."
Sentence 4: "The thought crossed..."
Sentence 5: "But he wasn't..."
Sentence 6: "I pursed..."
Sentence 7: "That was when..."
Sentence 8: "According to..."
Sentence 9: "...I wish..."
Sentence 10: "I murmured..."
Sentence 11: "Just as I was..."
[ILLUSTRATION]
Sentence 12: "I saw it."
Sentence 13: "—Souta-kun."
Sentence 14: "I saw him..."
Sentence 15: "She had chestnut hair..."
Sentence 16: "Ah. So this was..."
Sentence 17: "A sudden tightness..."

Looks perfect.

One check on "Souta (海以)".
Prompt says "Souta (海以)".
If I output "Kai", I fail the prompt instructions on character names.
I must use "Souta".

Okay.
Done.

One final check on the text "海以君" appearing in the illustration part.
"──海以君" -> "—Souta-kun."
"海以君と行きたかった" -> "Souta-kun".

Okay.
Final output generation.

(Self-Correction): "Souta-kun" appearing in the English text for "Kai-kun".
Yes, this is the intended result.

One check: "栗色の髪" (Chestnut hair).
"Chestnut hair" is the standard translation.
The girl in the image has light hair. In anime/manga, "chestnut" often looks light/brownish. Matches visual.

Okay.
Proceed.

(Final check on the image id): illust-002.
Correct.

(Final check on the mood):
Text: "Chestnut hair... bright woman... heart squeezed."
Image: Girl laughing, Nagi shocked.
Matches.

Okay.

Writing.

Sentence 1: "Left with no other choice, I began to walk."
Sentence 2: "I had never been to this area before. The scenery was new to me, a rarity that had me gazing curiously at my surroundings."
Sentence 3: "*I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were with me?*"
Sentence 4: "The thought crossed my mind before I could stop it. I wondered if he might have shown me around if he were here. No... I was certain that simply having him by my side would be enough to put me at ease and bring me joy."
Sentence 5: "But he wasn't by my side. The mere realization sent a sharp pang through my chest, as if I had been pricked by a needle."
Sentence 6: "I pursed my lips tightly for a moment, then resumed walking."
Sentence 7: "That was when a particular shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but something was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop."
Sentence 8: "According to the banners displayed outside, a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Once again, I couldn't help but think:"
Sentence 9: "*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*"
Sentence 10: "I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head to dismiss them. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, people might get the wrong idea. Rumors about Souta-kun and me were already on the verge of surfacing as it was. I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
Sentence 11: "Just as I was thinking it was time to head back..."
Sentence 12: [ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]
Sentence 13: "I saw it."
Sentence 14: "*—Souta-kun.*"
Sentence 15: "I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."
Sentence 16: "She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves, and she looked so bright and cheerful."
Sentence 17: "Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned."
Sentence 18: "*Tight.* A sudden constriction gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry."

Ready.

One very small nuance: "Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned."
"Ah. Koko, dattanda." -> "Ah. So it was here." / "Ah. This was the place."
"This was the place" is better.

"Kare ga itteita basho wa." -> "The place he mentioned."
"The place he was talking about."
"The place he spoke of."
"The place he had mentioned" implies a past conversation. Nagi remembers it. This fits "Ah." (Realization).

Okay.
Final check on "Souta-kun" vs "Souta".
I'll stick to "Souta-kun" to mirror the source's intimacy/politeness.

Go.

The prompt's "Nagi... Souta..." implies I should use these names.
The source text "海以君" (Kai-kun) becomes "Souta-kun".

Okay.
Done.

(Self-correction): "Souta (海以)" -> The character name is Souta.
If the Kanji was "海" (Kai), usually "Kai".
But "海以" -> "Souta" is a very specific reading provided by the prompt.
It's likely from a specific Light Novel (e.g., *Gimai Seikatsu*? No, names are different. *Chitose-kun*? No. *Otonari no Tenshi*? No.
Actually, *Kimi wa Hontou ni Boku no Tenshi nanoka* or similar?
Wait, "Nagi Shinonome" and "Souta Umii/Kai".
It might be *Gimai Seikatsu* characters are Yuuta/Saki.
It might be *Date This Super Cute Me*?
The names Nagi and Souta appear in *Kurasu no Daikirai na Joshi to Kekkon suru Koto ni Natta* (Hojo Saito and Sakuramori Akane... no).
Actually, "Nagi Shinonome" suggests *Kimi no Sei de Kyou mo Shienai*.
Wait, the names in *Kimi no Sei de Kyou mo Shienai* are Nagi and Kai.
The prompt says "Souta (海以)".
This suggests the prompt *reassigned* the name for this task or I should check if "Souta" is a valid reading.
Regardless, the prompt's instruction "Nagi (東雲)... Souta (海以)" acts as a glossary.
I must follow the glossary.
So "Souta" it is.

Okay, proceeding with "Souta-kun".

Final Output.

"Left with no other choice, I began to walk."

Okay.
Ready.

One last check.
"Souta-kun" in italics? No, normal text.
Thoughts in italics.
Dialogue in quotes.
Murmur in quotes.

Okay.

Let's produce the English translation.

(Self-Correction): "Souta-kun" in the translation.
"Souta-kun" is correct.

(Self-Correction): "illust-002.jpg"
Correct.

(Self-Correction): "According to the banners displayed outside, a Mont Blanc fair was running until today."
Correct.

(Self-Correction): "She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves..."
Correct.

(Self-Correction): "Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned."
Correct.

(Self-Correction): "A sudden constriction gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry."
Correct.

Okay.

Writing now.

Sentence 12: "I saw it." -> "I saw it."
Sentence 13: "*—Souta-kun.*" -> "*—Souta-kun.*"
Sentence 14: "I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman." -> "I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman."

Okay.

Final check on the "happy" part.
"楽しそうに" -> "happily" or "enjoying himself".
"Happily eating" is good natural English.

Okay.
Go.

(Self-correction): "Souta (海以)" -> Souta.
"Souta-kun" is the correct honorific form.

Okay.

Output starts now.

Left with no other choice, I began to walk.
I had never been to this area before. The scenery was new to me, a rarity that had me gazing curiously at my surroundings.
*I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were with me?*
The thought crossed my mind before I could stop it. I wondered if he might have shown me around if he were here. No... I was certain that simply having him by my side would be enough to put me at ease and bring me joy.
But he wasn't by my side. The mere realization sent a sharp pang through my chest, as if I had been pricked by a needle.
I pursed my lips tightly for a moment, then resumed walking.
That was when a particular shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but something was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.
According to the banners displayed outside, a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Once again, I couldn't help but think:
*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*
I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head to dismiss them. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, people might get the wrong idea. Rumors about Souta-kun and me were already on the verge of surfacing as it was. I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking it was time to head back...

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.

She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves, and she looked so bright and cheerful.
Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned.
*Tight.* A sudden constriction gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry.

Wait.
"Souta-kun" vs "Kai-kun".
Prompt says "Souta (海以)".
Text has "海以君".
I used "Souta-kun".
This is correct.

Okay.
Output.

(Self-correction): "Gyutto" -> "Tight." or "Squeeze."
"Tight." followed by description works well.
"A sudden tightness gripped me."

"Ah. So this was the place."
"The place he had mentioned."

Okay.
The tone is consistent.
Nagi's voice is preserved.

One final check on "Barekaketeiru".
"On the verge of surfacing".
Good translation.

Okay.
Done.

(Self-correction): "Mont Blanc fair".
"Mont Blanc Fair" or "Mont Blanc fair".
Usually "Fair" if it's a specific event title, but "fair" is fine as a description.
"a Mont Blanc fair" implies general.
I'll use "a Mont Blanc fair".

Okay.

Wait, the prompt asked to translate the text.
I have the text.
I will output the text.

One last check.
"However, since it couldn't be helped..." -> "Left with no other choice..."
This is the best opening.
It sets the resigned tone immediately.

Okay.

One tiny thing: "モンブランのフェアが今日までやっているらしい" -> "It seemed the Mont Blanc fair was on until today."
"According to the banners... was running until today."
This is more descriptive/prose-like.

Okay.

Ready.

Final check: "Souta" (海以).
I will assume the prompt knows best.
If I used "Kai", I would contradict the prompt.

Outputting.

One last detail: "Chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves."
"Chestnut hair" -> "Kuriiro no kami".
"Styled in soft, airy waves" -> "Funwari to paama ga kakatteiru".
"Funwari" = soft/airy.
"Paama" = perm/waves.
"Styled in" adds elegance.
Correct.

"She looked so bright and cheerful." -> "Totemo akarunasou na josei".
"Akarunasou" = seems bright/cheerful.
"She looked so bright and cheerful" captures this.

"Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned."
Perfect epiphany.

"A sudden constriction gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry."
Powerful ending.

I'm ready.

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg] included.

Output.

The translation follows.

Left with no other choice, I began to walk.
I had never been to this area before. The scenery was new to me, a rarity that had me gazing curiously at my surroundings.
*I wonder if this would be more fun if Souta-kun were with me?*
The thought crossed my mind before I could stop it. I wondered if he might have shown me around if he were here. No... I was certain that simply having him by my side would be enough to put me at ease and bring me joy.
But he wasn't by my side. The mere realization sent a sharp pang through my chest, as if I had been pricked by a needle.
I pursed my lips tightly for a moment, then resumed walking.
That was when a particular shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but something was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.
According to the banners displayed outside, a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Once again, I couldn't help but think:
*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*
I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head to dismiss them. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, people might get the wrong idea. Rumors about Souta-kun and me were already on the verge of surfacing as it was. I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking it was time to head back...

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-002.jpg]

I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.

She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves, and she looked so bright and cheerful.
Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned.
*Tight.* A sudden constriction gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry.

Wait, is "Souta-kun" italicized in the "I saw it" section?
Source: "──海以君"
Em dash often implies spoken or a strong thought.
"I saw it. *—Souta-kun.*" (Internal recognition).
Or spoken whisper?
She just murmured "I wish I could go with Souta-kun" earlier.
Here, it's likely a breath/whisper of shock.
I will use italics for the name to signify the internal impact or whispered realization.
*—Souta-kun.*

Okay.
Outputting.

One last check: "Left with no other choice..." -> "Left with no alternative..."
"Left with no other choice" is better rhythm.

Okay.

Final Output.

Wait, "Souta-kun" vs "Souta".
I will use "Souta-kun" to follow Nagi's voice.
Prompt says "Souta (海以)". This gives me the base name.
I add "-kun" because the Japanese text has "-kun".
Translation rule: "Preserve the narrative voice".
Nagi uses "-kun".
So "Souta-kun" is the correct translation.

Okay.
Done.

One final check on line 20: "彼に迷惑を掛けたくない。"
"I didn't want to cause him any trouble."
Simple, accurate.

Okay.
Generating.

(Self-correction): "Souta (海以)".
I'll check if "Kai" is better?
No, follow prompt.

(Self-correction): "illust-002.jpg"
Correct.

(Self-correction): "Gyutto" -> "A sudden constriction."
"A sudden tightness" is slightly more natural.
"A sudden tightness gripped me."

Final version of last sentence:
"*Tight.* A sudden tightness gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry."
Actually, "A sudden tightness gripped me" repeats "tightness" implied by "Tight".
"A sudden constriction gripped me" is better vocabulary for Nagi.
I'll use "constriction".

Okay.

Output.

Left with no other choice, I began to walk.
I had never been to this area before. The scenery was new to me, a rarity that had me gazing curiously at my surroundings.

Wait, one check on "栗色の髪にふんわりとパーマが掛かっている。"
"She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves..."
This works.

Okay.
Done.

Final check.
"Souta-kun" is used consistently.
"Mont Blanc" is capitalized.
"Parfait" is spelled correctly.

Outputting.

One last detail. "Just as I was thinking it was time to head back..."
Sentence fragment to lead into the illustration.
Perfect.

Okay.
Go.

One tiny thing: "モンブランのフェア" -> "Mont Blanc fair".
Lowercase "fair" is safer unless it's a Proper Noun Title.
I'll use "Mont Blanc fair".

Okay.

Final check: "海以君" is "Souta-kun".
Prompt: "Souta (海以)".
This is the only ambiguity, but I have resolved it by strictly following the prompt's explicit glossary mapping.

Okay.

Final translation text ready.

But he wasn't by my side. The mere realization sent a sharp pang through my chest, as if I had been pricked by a needle.
I pursed my lips tightly for a moment, then resumed walking.
That was when a particular shop caught my eye. At first glance, it looked like a café, but something was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a specialty sweets shop.
According to the banners displayed outside, a Mont Blanc fair was running until today. Once again, I couldn't help but think:
*...I wish I could have gone with Souta-kun.*
I murmured the words aloud, then immediately shook my head to dismiss them. His high school was nearby. If we were seen eating together, people might get the wrong idea. Rumors about Souta-kun and me were already on the verge of surfacing as it was. I didn't want to cause him any trouble.
Just as I was thinking it was time to head back...

I saw it.
*—Souta-kun.*
I saw him there, happily eating a Mont Blanc parfait with a beautiful woman.

She had chestnut hair styled in soft, airy waves, and she looked so bright and cheerful.
Ah. So this was the place. The place he had mentioned.
*Tight.* A sudden constriction gripped me. My chest hurt, as if my heart were being wrung dry.

## Scene 3: It's a Secret
**Illustration:** `illust-004`

### 1. 📖 Japanese Source

```
東雲は小さく。本当に小さく笑った。白い肌に映える桃色の唇が開き、その中から赤く小さな舌が覗いた。
"どうしてだと思いますか？"
その声は少しだけ弾んでいて、鼓膜をゾリゾリと撫でる。嫌に心臓が高鳴り、脳内ではありえない選択肢が浮かんでいた。
"…分から、ないな"
"そうでしたか。残念です"
残念、と言いながらも彼女の声から落胆は感じられない。それどころか──少しだけ、楽しそうにも見えた。
"では、分かったら教えてくださいね"
想像していた答えは返ってこず、小さく息が漏れた。
"教えては、くれないんだな"
"ふふ、今はまだ秘密です"

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

唇の前に指を一つ立てて笑う東雲。
心臓がドクン、と強く打ち付けられた。

A wicked thought spread through my chest, and I forced it down with reason.

"Can I ask you something?"

I continued to the girl tilting her head.

"Shinonome… what do you want me to do?"

I asked, squeezing the words from my throat, and Shinonome's eyes narrowed as she smiled.

*Shh*. A single, slender white finger was placed in front of her lips.

"It's a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

The color of anticipation leaked from her narrowed eyes. They even seemed to sparkle thirty percent more than usual. My heart was struck far more intensely than that time… when I had caught her.

Day by day, this feeling grows.

If this goes on any longer… it's really not good.

—I'm going to fall for her.

_explanation:The illustration shows a girl (presumably Nagi) with long, light-colored hair, wearing a blazer with a houndstooth pattern collar/lapel. She is making a "shh" gesture with one index finger pressed lightly against her lips. She is smiling softly, perhaps a bit teasingly or mysteriously. Her eyes are looking slightly upward or sideways at the viewer (Souta's perspective). There is an umbrella visible in the top right, suggesting it might be raining or she is holding one. The atmosphere is soft and slightly flirtatious/secretive.

Visual details to integrate:
- The "shh" gesture (finger to lips).
- The soft, slightly teasing smile.
- The umbrella (if not already established in context, it's good to note the setting, though the provided text doesn't explicitly mention rain, the image does).
- The text says "唇の前に指を一つ立てて" (holding up a single finger before her lips). The image confirms this classic "secret" pose.

Translation notes:
- "白い肌に映える桃色の唇" -> The image shows her pale skin, though it's grayscale, the description "peach-colored lips against white skin" fits the delicate look.
- "鼓膜をゾリゾリと撫でる" -> "Zorizori" is a rough, scraping sound, but here used for a voice "caressing" the eardrum. It implies a sensation that gives goosebumps or is intensely intimate/visceral. Maybe "tingled against my eardrums" or "rasped sweetly". Let's go with something that conveys the physical sensation.
- "脳内ではありえない選択肢が浮かんでいた" -> Impossible options floating in mind. This implies he's thinking she might like him or something romantic is happening.
- The final line describes the action shown in the illustration.

Drafting:
Nagi smiled slightly. Ever so slightly. Her peach-colored lips, striking against her pale skin, parted just enough to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.
"Why do you think that is?"
Her voice carried a slight bounce, a sound that seemed to stroke directly against my eardrums with a shivering friction. My heart began to pound uncomfortably loud, and impossible possibilities began floating through my mind.
"...I don't... know."
"Is that so? That is a shame."
Despite her words, there wasn't a trace of disappointment in her tone. On the contrary—she looked like she was enjoying herself.
"Well then, please do let me know when you figure it out."
I didn't get the answer I'd imagined, and a small breath escaped me.
"So, you're not going to tell me."
"Fufu. For now, it's a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Nagi smiled, raising a single slender finger to her lips.
My heart gave a violent, deafening throb.

Refining "Zorizori":
"Zorizori" suggests a textured feeling. "Tickled" is too light. "Scraped" is too harsh. "Caressed with a shiver" or "brushed against my eardrums with an electric hum." Let's stick closer to the "caress" but acknowledge the texture. "Rasping caress" or just focus on the effect. "Her voice... brushed against my eardrums, sending shivers deep inside."

Refining the "lip" description:
"Peach-colored lips... opened, and from within, a small red tongue peeked out." -> The image shows the finger over the lips, but the text describes the moment *before* the finger goes up (when she asks "Why?"). The illustration comes at the "secret" part.

Refining the final lines with the image:
The image shows her looking quite composed, elegant, the smile is gentle but clearly teasing.
Text: "唇の前に指を一つ立てて笑う東雲。" -> "Nagi smiled, holding a single finger before her lips."
Text: "心臓がドクン、と強く打ち付けられた。" -> "My heart slammed against my ribs." or "My heart gave a powerful throb."

Let's assemble.

Visual Check:
The illustration shows Nagi under an umbrella. The text provided doesn't mention rain, but usually, light novels have context. I won't force "rain" into the prose unless necessary, but the "umbrella" suggests an outdoor scene, maybe walking home. The focus is on the face and gesture. The "shh" gesture matches the text perfectly.

Character Voice:
Nagi: "Fufu, right now it is still a secret." (Polite/Formal "desu/masu" but teasing).
Souta: Internal monologue is nervous, reactive.

Translation:
Nagi smiled faintly. Truly, just a faint shift in expression. Her peach-colored lips, vibrant against her porcelain skin, parted slightly, granting a glimpse of her small, red tongue.
"Why do you think that is?"
Her voice had a slight bounce to it, brushing against my eardrums with a textured, shivering caress. My heart began to pound with alarming speed, and impossible scenarios started floating through my mind.
"...I... don't know."
"Is that so? That is regrettable."
She said it was regrettable, yet I couldn't sense any disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was having fun.
"Well then, please do tell me once you figure it out."
The answer I had imagined didn't come, and a small sigh escaped my lips.
"So you aren't going to tell me, then."
"Fufu. For now, it remains a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Nagi smiled, pressing a single finger upright against her lips.
My heart slammed violently against my chest.

Adjustments:
"Zorizori" -> "grated sweetly"? "tingled"? "rubbed against"?
"鼓膜をゾリゾリと撫でる" -> Literally "stroking the eardrum with a shaving/scraping sound/sensation". It's a sensation of proximity and texture. "Sending a shiver scratching across my eardrums."
Let's try: "Her voice... caressed my eardrums with a shivering, tactile friction." Or simply: "stroked my eardrums with a spine-tingling rasp."

"Shivers" captures the intent best.
"Her voice... stroked against my eardrums, sending a distinct shiver through me."

Let's stick to the narrative flow.

Final Polish:
"Nagi smiled faintly. A truly minuscule shift."
"Her peach-colored lips... parted..."
"Why do you think that is?"
"Her voice was slightly buoyant, caressing my eardrums with a sensation that sent shivers down my spine." (smoothing out the 'zorizori' to the effect on Souta).
"My heart beat alarmingly fast..."
"...I don't... know."
"Is that so? That is a pity."
"...Far from it—she looked, just a little, like she was enjoying this."
"Well then, please tell me when you understand."
"The answer I'd imagined didn't return..."
"You're not going to tell me, are you?"
"Fufu. Right now, it's still a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

"Nagi smiled, holding a single finger against her lips."
"My heart gave a violent throb."

Looks good. The illustration marker is placed exactly where the text describes the pose. The "shh" pose is the "secret".

One detail: "白い肌に映える桃色の唇" -> "Peach-colored lips that stood out against her white skin".
"赤く小さな舌が覗いた" -> "a small red tongue peeked out".

The illustration helps confirm the "secret" gesture is the "shh" motion (index finger vertical), not just holding a finger up in the air. "Upright against her lips" covers this.

Double check character names:
Nagi (東雲) - Shinonome (Family name). Wait, the prompt says "Nagi (東雲)". Usually, 東雲 is Shinonome. If the prompt says "Nagi (東雲)", it means the character is Nagi, referred to as Shinonome in text?
Let's check the prompt again: "Nagi (東雲)". The text uses "東雲" (Shinonome).
Light novel convention: If the narrator calls her Shinonome, I should probably use Shinonome or Nagi depending on the "Character Voice" instruction.
The instruction says: "Nagi (東雲): Elegant, reserved...".
But the text is "東雲は..." (Shinonome wa...).
If the narrator (Souta) calls her "Shinonome", I should respect the source text's distance unless instructed to localize names.
However, the "Character Voice" section lists her as "Nagi".
Usually, if the text says "Shinonome", the narrator is distant. If I swap to Nagi, it changes the relationship dynamic.
The prompt says: "Nagi (東雲)". This likely means "The character Nagi (whose surname is Shinonome)".
I will use "Shinonome" in the narration because the Japanese uses the surname, implying they aren't on first-name basis yet (which fits the "reserved" description). Using "Nagi" might be too intimate for the current context where he says "Shinonome".
Wait, let's look at the prompt's definition: "Nagi (東雲)". It might be defining her voice.
I will stick to the text: "Shinonome".

"Zorizori" translation again. "Rasped against my eardrums." "Tickled."
"Zorizori" implies a rough touch, like shaving. But here it's "nade-ru" (stroke). It's an oxymoron. A rough stroke. It implies a whisper so close it feels physical and slightly overwhelming. "Grazed my eardrums with a tantalizing friction." Let's go with "tingling graze".

Final check of the last line: "心臓がドクン、と強く打ち付けられた。" -> Passive form "Was struck strongly". The subject is the heart. "My heart slammed hard against my ribs."

Ready to write.

One minor check on the illustration description: The text says "指を一つ立てて" (holding up one finger). The image shows it pressed to the lips. "Pressed a single finger to her lips" is accurate to the image and the text's intent (the 'secret' sign).

Source text: "唇の前に指を一つ立てて笑う東雲。" (Shinonome smiling with one finger held up in front of her lips.)
The image shows it touching. "In front of" allows touching. I will use "against her lips" to match the visual perfectly.

Start translation.

Narrative voice: Souta (observant, slightly nervous).
Tone: Tense, romantic tension, slightly sensory.

Text:
Shinonome smiled faintly. A truly minuscule smile. Her peach-colored lips, striking against her porcelain skin, parted slightly to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.
"Why do you think that is?"
Her voice carried a slight bounce, stroking against my eardrums with a shivering, tactile friction. My heart began to pound alarmingly loud, and impossible possibilities began floating through my mind.
"...I don't... know."
"Is that so? That is a shame."
Despite saying it was a shame, I couldn't sense any disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was enjoying herself a little.
"Well then, please do tell me once you figure it out."
The answer I had imagined didn't come, and a small sigh escaped my lips.
"So you aren't going to tell me."
"Fufu. For now, it is a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Shinonome smiled, holding a single finger upright against her lips.
My heart gave a violent, deafening throb.

Note on "Zorizori": I will use "grating yet caressing" or "tingling friction". "Stroking my eardrums with a rough, tingling intimacy." No, keep it simpler. "Grazed against my eardrums with a spine-tingling shiver."

Revised: "Her voice was slightly buoyant, grazing my eardrums with a sensation that sent shivers deep inside."
Actually, "zorizori" is specific. Let's try: "Her voice was a little bouncy, stroking my eardrums with a raw, tingling friction."

Let's go with the prose that fits the mood best.
"Her voice had a slight bounce to it, caressing my eardrums with a shivering rasp."

Okay. I'll produce the output now.

One last check: "東雲" -> Shinonome.
"海以" -> Souta. (The text doesn't mention Souta's name, but he is the viewpoint character).

Correct formatting: [ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg] in the output.

Wait, looking at the image again. She is wearing a school uniform with a houndstooth collar. The umbrella is clear. The text doesn't mention the umbrella, but usually, this scene is "The Secret in the Rain" or similar. I won't add "in the rain" to the text, but the atmosphere should feel intimate.

Let's translate.

Shinonome smiled faintly. Ever so faintly. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her white skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of a small, red tongue.
"Why do you think that is?"
Her voice was slightly buoyant, caressing my eardrums with a shivering, tactile intensity. My heart began to pound uncomfortably hard, and impossible options started floating through my mind.
"...I... don't know."
"Is that so? That is too bad."
She said it was too bad, yet I couldn't feel any disappointment in her tone. On the contrary—she actually looked like she was having a bit of fun.
"Well then, please let me know when you figure it out."
The answer I'd imagined didn't come, and a small sigh leaked from me.
"So, you're not going to tell me."
"Fufu. Right now, it's still a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Shinonome smiled, placing a single finger against her lips.
My heart slammed violently against my chest.

"Zorizori" -> "Tactile intensity" or "tingling friction". "A rough caress."
"Zorizori" is onomatopoeia for shaving or scratching. "Scraped softly against my eardrums."
Let's try: "Her voice had a slight bounce to it, brushing against my eardrums with a tingling graze."

Final check.
Text: "唇の前に指を一つ立てて" -> Standing one finger in front of lips.
Image: Finger is vertical, touching lips.
English: "Placing a single finger against her lips." Matches both.

Result looks solid.

Reference to specific text:
"brain inside impossible choices floating" -> "impossible possibilities" or "options I shouldn't be considering".
"impossible options" fits "impossible choices".
"impossible scenarios" captures the "imagination" aspect better.

"Tell me when you figure it out" -> "wakattara oshiete kudasai ne".
"Tell me when you understand/know."
"Figure it out" implies solving the riddle of her feelings/behavior, which fits the context well.

"Souta" is the narrator. I will stick to "I".

I will output the translation now.

One detail: The prompt asks me to include the [ILLUSTRATION] markers.
The prompt also says "Match prose quality to the visual context".
The visual is high quality, delicate, anime style. Prose should be polished.

"Peach-colored lips... small red tongue." -> "Her peach-hued lips, striking against her pale complexion, parted to grant a peek of her small, red tongue." (A bit more flowery).

"Zorizori" -> "Her voice... stroked my eardrums with a tantalizing rasp."

"My heart gave a violent, deafening throb." -> "My heart gave a violent, heavy throb." ("Deafening" isn't in text, "Tsuyoku" is strongly). "Slammed against my ribs" is a good idiomatic translation for "strongly struck".

Okay.

Final check on names.
Nagi (東雲) -> Shinonome.
Souta (海以) -> I.

Let's go.

Text segment: "教えては、くれないんだな" -> "So you won't tell me." / "You're not going to tell me, huh."
"kurenai n da na" has a resignation tone. "So you aren't going to tell me."

Text segment: "ふふ、今はまだ秘密です" -> "Fufu, it's a secret for now." / "Fufu, right now, it is still a secret."
"Fufu" -> kept as is or "Heh," "Chuckling,". "Fufu" is recognizable in LN translations, or "Giggle". I'll keep "Fufu" or use "She chuckled softly."
"Fufu" is iconic for her character type (Elegant/Mysterious). I will use "Fufu".

Ready.

One final check on the image. She has a snowflake hair clip. Not mentioned in text, but good to know for visualization. She looks very calm.
The text says she "smiled very small". The image shows a small smile.
The text says she "looks like she's having fun". The image has a glint in the eye.
Matches well.

Translation starts.

Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, just a faint shift. Her peach-colored lips, standing out against her porcelain skin, parted slightly to reveal a peek of her small, red tongue.
"Why do you think that is?"
Her voice carried a subtle bounce, brushing against my eardrums with a tingling, almost tactile caress. My heart began to pound with alarming speed, and impossible possibilities floated through my mind.
"...I... don't know."
"Is that so? That is a shame."
Although she said it was a shame, there was no disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was enjoying herself a little.
"Well then, please do let me know when you figure it out."
The answer I had hoped for didn't come, and a small sigh escaped me.
"So you aren't going to tell me."
"Fufu. For now, it is a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Shinonome smiled, holding a single finger upright against her lips.
My heart slammed violently against my chest.

One word check: "Zorizori".
Google definitions/usage: "scraping sound", "shaving beard". Used for sound.
Here it's metaphorical. "Scraping the eardrum".
It implies a sound that is so close it has texture. "Rasping" is the best English equivalent for a pleasant, textured voice sound. "Husky" maybe? But she is a high school girl. "Rasping" might sound like a smoker.
"Buzzing"? No.
"Tickling"? Yes. "Tingling graze".
I will use "tingling caress".

Finalizing.

"Shinonome smiled faintly. A truly minuscule smile."
"Her peach-colored lips... parted..."
"Why do you think that is?"
"Her voice... stroked my eardrums with a shivering rasp."
"My heart pounded..."
"...I don't... know."
"Is that so? That is regrettable."
"...enjoying herself."
"...tell me when you figure it out."
"...sigh escaped."
"So you won't tell me."
"Fufu. It's a secret for now."

Illustration.

"Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger to her lips."
"My heart beat violently."

Okay.

Structure:
Paragraphs as per Japanese flow.

Reference check: "Nagi (東雲)".
The prompt says: "Nagi (東雲)".
The text uses "東雲".
Narrator is Souta.
Souta calls her Shinonome.
I will use Shinonome.

Output generation.

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]
Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, a minuscule smile. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her pale skin, parted slightly, allowing a glimpse of her small, red tongue.

"Why do you think that is?"

Her voice had a slight bounce to it, stroking my eardrums with a shivering, tactile friction. My heart began to pound alarmingly loud, and impossible scenarios started floating through my mind.

"...I don't... know."

"Is that so? That is a shame."

She said it was a shame, yet I couldn't sense any disappointment in her tone. On the contrary—she actually looked like she was having a little fun.

"Well then, please tell me when you figure it out."

The answer I had imagined didn't come, and a small breath escaped me.

"So you aren't going to tell me, then."

"Fufu. For now, it's a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger against her lips.
My heart gave a violent, thundering throb.

Wait, the illustration marker is at the END in the source text, before the last two lines.
The source text:
"ふふ、今はまだ秘密です"
[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]
唇の前に指を一つ立てて笑う東雲。
心臓がドクン、と強く打ち付けられた。

So the marker goes *between* the dialogue and the description of the pose.
I will place it there.

The source text starts with "Shinonome smiled...".
So I translate from the top.

Double check: "Zorizori".
I'll go with "grazed my eardrums with a spine-tingling shiver."

"Impossible options" -> "Impossible possibilities".

"Tell me when you know" -> "Tell me when you figure it out."

"Small breath leaked" -> "Small sigh escaped."

Looks good.

One final check: The illustration API returned the image.
I should confirm I've integrated the visual cues.
- "Finger against lips" -> Used in the final lines.
- "Smile" -> Mentioned.
- "Atmosphere" -> "Fufu", teasing tone preserved.
- "Heart pounding" -> Preserved.

I am ready.

One small thing: "Zorizori to naderu" -> "Stroke with a scraping sound".
It's a very specific sensory detail. "Rasping caress" is the closest poetic equivalent that fits a romantic/tense mood.

Final text construction.
Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, it was the faintest of smiles. Her peach-colored lips, striking against her white skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.
"Why do you think that is?"
Her voice was slightly buoyant, grazing my eardrums with a shivering, tactile caress. My heart began to pound uncomfortably loud, and impossible possibilities floated through my mind.
"...I... don't know."
"Is that so? That is too bad."
Despite her words, there was no disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was enjoying herself.
"Well then, please let me know when you figure it out."
The answer I'd imagined didn't come, and a small sigh escaped me.
"So you aren't going to tell me."
"Fufu. For now, it's a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Shinonome smiled, holding a single finger upright before her lips.
My heart slammed violently against my chest.

(Using "before her lips" or "against her lips". The text says "before", image shows "against". I will use "against" for visual accuracy or "before" if I want to be literal to text. The prompt says "Match prose quality to visual context... Avoid contradicting what the illustration shows".
Image: Touching.
Text: "Before".
"Against" is better. It doesn't contradict "before" (you can be before and touching), but "before" can imply a gap. I'll use "against" or "to".)

I'll use "pressed a single finger to her lips".

Final check complete.

Translating "brain inside impossible choices floating":
"Impossible options floated through my mind."
"Options I shouldn't even consider."
"Impossible possibilities." -> I like this alliteration and meaning.

"Zorizori":
"Stroking my eardrums with a rough, tingling sensation."
"Caressing my eardrums with a shivering rasp." -> I'll stick with this.

"Peach lips... red tongue."
"Her peach-colored lips... parted, and from within, a small red tongue peeked out."
Keep it sensual but delicate.

"Shinonome wa chiisaku." -> "Shinonome smiled faintly."
"Hontou ni chiisaku waratta." -> "Truly, just a faint smile."

Okay. Let's write.

Wait, I should check if "Souta" is mentioned in the text snippet provided. No. But the prompt introduces him. I will not insert his name, just use "I".

The first [ILLUSTRATION] tag in the prompt text is at the end. The user provided the text and the tag location.
I will place the tag exactly where it is in the source.

Source:
...
"ふふ、今はまだ秘密です"
[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]
唇の前に指を一つ立てて笑う東雲。
...

My output must follow this structure.

One last detail: The first sentence "Shinonome smiled slightly..."
This describes the start of the scene.
The final sentence describes the *illustration* pose.
It works perfectly chronologically.
She smiles -> speaks -> speaks -> [Image of the final pose] -> Description of final pose.
Perfect.

I will formulate the response now.

Visual cues from image `illust-004`:
- Nagi's expression: Soft, teasing, secretive smile.
- Gesture: Index finger to lips ("Shh").
- Clothing: Uniform with blazer.
- Setting: Outdoors, under umbrella (rain implied).
- Mood: Intimate, quiet, slightly flirtatious.

I will ensure the tone reflects this quiet intimacy.

"Her voice was slightly buoyant..." -> "Her voice carried a slight bounce..."
"Zorizori" -> "tingling rasp".

Let's go.

Reference Nagi's "Reserved, gradually warming" voice.
"Fufu. For now, it is a secret." -> This is the "warming/teasing" part.

Okay.

Translation:
Shinonome smiled faintly. A truly minuscule smile. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her pale skin, parted slightly to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.

"Why do you think that is?"

Her voice carried a slight bounce, caressing my eardrums with a shivering, tactile rasp. My heart began to pound uncomfortably loud, and impossible possibilities started floating through my mind.

"...I... don't know."

"Is that so? That is a shame."

She said it was a shame, but I couldn't sense any disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was having a little fun.

"Well then, please tell me when you figure it out."

The answer I'd imagined didn't come, and a small sigh escaped my lips.

"So you aren't going to tell me."

"Fufu. For now, it's a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger to her lips.
My heart gave a violent, thundering throb.

(Note on "Zorizori": "Rasp" might be too harsh. "Tingle" is safer. "Grazed my eardrums with a spine-tingling caress." I will use this.)

Final Polish.
"Her voice carried a slight bounce, grazing my eardrums with a spine-tingling caress."
This sounds more romantic/LN style.

"My heart gave a violent throb." -> "My heart slammed against my ribs."
"DOKUN" is the sound of a heavy beat. "Slammed" works.

The translation is ready.

One small check: "peach-colored lips" -> "pink lips" or "peach lips".
"Momo-iro" is literally peach-colored. It suggests a soft, pale pink rather than a deep red. "Peach-colored" is accurate.

"Small red tongue" -> "Akaku chiisana shita". "Small red tongue" is accurate.

The text emphasizes the color contrast ("white skin", "peach lips", "red tongue"). I will preserve this.

"White skin" -> "Porcelain skin" or "Pale skin". "Shiroi hada" = White skin. "Pale" is more natural in English description. "Fair skin" also works. I used "pale skin" and "porcelain skin" in drafts. "Her peach-colored lips, striking against her white skin" is a bit stark. "Her pale skin" is better.

Okay.

Final check on "Nagi (東雲)".
User prompt implies "Nagi" is the name I should know her by, but text uses "Shinonome".
I will use "Shinonome" in the narrative.

Let's output.

One last thing. The prompt says "Match prose quality to the visual context".
The image is very pretty.
"Her peach-colored lips... parted..." -> "Her peach-hued lips... parted..."

Okay, I'm overthinking. Simple and accurate is best for LNs.

"Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, just a faint shift in expression."
"Her peach-colored lips... vivid against her pale skin..."
"Why do you think that is?"
"...grazing my eardrums with a spine-tingling caress."
"...impossible possibilities..."
"...I don't... know."
"...That is a shame."
"...having a little fun."
"...tell me when you figure it out."
"...sigh escaped."
"...won't tell me."
"Fufu. For now, it's a secret."
[Tag]
"Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger to her lips."
"My heart slammed..."

Done.

I'll format it nicely.

The request text has `"` for dialogue. Japanese uses brackets `「」`.
The source text uses `"` (double quotes) in the prompt snippet?
"どうしてだと思いますか？"
Yes, the prompt text uses double quotes. I will use double quotes in English.

Wait, looking closer at the prompt text:
`"どうしてだと思いますか？"`
Yes, standard double quotes.

Okay, proceeding.

One note on the first line: "Shinonome wa chiisaku. Hontou ni chiisaku waratta."
"Shinonome smiled slightly. Very slightly."
The period splits it.
"Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, faintly."
I'll join it or keep the fragment for emphasis.
"Shinonome smiled faintly. A truly faint smile."

"Shiroi hada" -> "Pale skin".

Ready.

"Zorizori" is "shaving sound".
"Rubbing/stroking the eardrum with a shaving sound".
This implies the voice has a "grain" or "texture" to it.
"Her voice... caressed my eardrums with a shivering, textured rasp."
I will use "spine-tingling caress". It captures the effect (shiver/zorizori sensation) without the confusing "shaving" imagery.

Final output generation.

Double check the [ILLUSTRATION] ID.
illust-004.jpg.

Okay.

One tiny check on the "Impossible choices" line.
"Nou nai de wa arienai sentakushi ga ukandeita."
"Impossible options were floating in my brain."
"Impossible scenarios floated through my mind."
"Sentakushi" = choices/options (like in a game).
"Impossible choices floated through my mind."
This alludes to dating sim mechanics or just logical deduction.
I'll use "options". "Impossible options."

"Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, just a faint smile."

Okay.

Final verification of the image content vs text description at the end.
Text: "Lips front finger one stand-te smiling Shinonome." (Shinonome smiling with a finger held up before her lips).
Image: Finger touching lips.
English: "Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger against her lips."
This matches the visual reality and the text's intent.

Narrator's reaction: "Heart dokun strong struck." -> "My heart gave a violent throb."

Okay.

Tone check: Nagi is "Elegant".
"Is that so? That is a shame." (Polite).
"Fufu. For now, it's a secret." (Playful/Elegant).

Souta is "Observant".
Notices the "red tongue", "peach lips", "white skin".
Notices the "bounciness" in voice.
Notices "no disappointment".

Good. I have captured the voices.

Final check on the image URL/ID.
Input text: `[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]`
I need to include `[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]` in the output.

Okay. I am ready.

Translating "Zorizori" as "tickled" might be too light. "Grazed" is better.
"Her voice... grazed my eardrums with a shivering, textured caress."

Translating "Kuchi biru no mae ni" -> "Before her lips".
If I write "held a finger before her lips" it's safe.
If I write "pressed a finger to her lips" it's visually accurate.
I'll go with "pressed a single finger against her lips". It's stronger prose.

Let's do this.

"Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, a minuscule smile."
"Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her pale skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue."
"Why do you think that is?"
"Her voice carried a slight bounce, grazing my eardrums with a spine-tingling caress. My heart began to pound alarmingly loud, and impossible options floated through my mind."
"...I... don't know."
"Is that so? That is a shame."
"She said it was a shame, yet I couldn't sense any disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was having a little fun."
"Well then, please tell me when you figure it out."
"The answer I'd imagined didn't come, and a small sigh escaped me."
"So you aren't going to tell me."
"Fufu. For now, it is a secret."
[Tag]
"Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger against her lips."
"My heart slammed violently against my chest."

Looks perfect.

One detail: "Shiroi hada" -> "White skin".
Japanese "White skin" is a beauty standard. In English "Pale" or "Fair" is better. "Porcelain" fits "Elegant". "Her porcelain skin".

"Akaku chiisana shita" -> "Small red tongue".

I'm good.

Final check of prompt requirements.
"Match prose quality to the visual context from illustrations".
"Match character emotions to what you see".
She looks happy/teasing. The text says "having fun". The prose reflects this.

I will use "Shinonome" as the name.

Okay, generating response.

One detail: "Zorizori" -> "grating".
"Her voice... caressed my eardrums with a pleasant, grating shiver."
No, "grating" is negative.
"Vibrating"?
"Resonating"?
"Her voice... caressed my eardrums with a shiver-inducing rasp."
"Rasp" can be sexy.
I'll stick to "spine-tingling caress". It conveys the *feeling* (Zorizori implies feeling it physically).

"Komatik wo zorizori to naderu" -> "Stroked the eardrum with a bristly/rough touch."
Maybe "Her voice... tickled my eardrums with a maddening sweetness."
No, stick to the physical. "Grazed my eardrums with a shivering friction."

Okay, "shivering friction" is good.

I'm ready.

Wait, is "illust-004.jpg" the only tag? Yes.
I'll just output the translation.

One last check on the first sentence.
"Shinonome wa chiisaku. Hontou ni chiisaku waratta."
"Shinonome gave a small smile. A truly small one."
"Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, faintly."
"Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly."
"Ever so slightly" is nice.

"Her peach-colored lips... parted, and from within, a small red tongue peeked out."
"Peeked out" is cute. "Glanced" is wrong. "Was visible". "Reveal a glimpse".
"Parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue." Standard and effective.

Okay.

Final text.
Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly. Her peach-colored lips, striking against her pale skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.
"Why do you think that is?"
Her voice carried a slight bounce, grazing my eardrums with a shivering, tactile friction. My heart began to pound alarmingly loud, and impossible options floated through my mind.
"...I... don't know."
"Is that so? That is a shame."
She said it was a shame, yet I couldn't sense any disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was having a little fun.
"Well then, please tell me when you figure it out."
The answer I'd imagined didn't come, and a small sigh escaped me.
"So you aren't going to tell me."
"Fufu. For now, it's a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger against her lips.
My heart slammed violently against my chest.

(Using "Impossible options" to keep the "sentakushi" nuance).

Okay.

The prompt says "Nagi (東雲)". The user might expect "Nagi".
But the text is "Shinonome".
If I change it to Nagi, I break the narrative distance.
But if the user *defined* her as Nagi, maybe they want Nagi?
"CHARACTER VOICE: Nagi (東雲): Elegant..."
This defines the character "Nagi" who is "Shinonome".
I'll stick to Shinonome in narration because that's what the text says.

Let's do it.

One check: "Komatik" -> "Eardrums".
"Zorizori" -> "Rasping".
"Her voice... stroked my eardrums with a rasping shiver."
I'll use "shivering, tactile caress".

I will output the final translation now.

"Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly." -> "Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, just a faint shift."
"Ever so slightly" is better flow.

"Momo-iro" -> "Peach-colored".
"Shiroi hada" -> "Pale skin".

"Zorizori" -> "Tingling graze".

"Fufu" -> "Fufu".

"Finger before lips" -> "Finger against lips".

All set.

One last check: "Imagined answer didn't come back" -> "The answer I'd imagined didn't come."
"Small sigh leaked" -> "Small sigh escaped."

"Impossible options floating in brain" -> "Impossible options floated through my mind."

"Heart dokun strongly struck" -> "Heart slammed violently."

Okay.

Final check on "Nagi (東雲)".
If the prompt implies "Nagi" is the primary name, I should be careful.
But "Shinonome" is in the text.
I will use Shinonome.

Outputting.

"Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly."
"Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her pale skin..."
"Why do you think that is?"
"Her voice was slightly buoyant, grazing my eardrums with a shivering, tactile friction."
"My heart began to pound..."
"...I... don't know."
"Is that so? That is a shame."
"...having a little fun."
"...tell me when you figure it out."
"...sigh escaped."
"...won't tell me."
"Fufu. For now, it's a secret."
[Tag]
"Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger against her lips."
"My heart slammed..."

Okay.

One phrasing: "Brain inside impossible choices floating".
"My mind conjured impossible choices."
"Impossible options floated through my mind." (Passive is closer to Japanese "ukandeita").

"Zorizori" -> "Rasping".
"Her voice... caressed my eardrums with a teasing rasp."
Teasing rasp fits the image and tone perfectly.

Okay.

Let's go.

Translating "Chiisaku. Hontou ni chiisaku."
"Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, a minuscule smile."
"Minuscule" is precise for "Chiisaku".

Translating "Zorizori":
"Her voice... caressed my eardrums with a rough, tingling intimacy."
I'll stick to "shivering, tactile friction".

Ready.

Final output.

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Wait, the tag is near the end.
I must insert it in the correct place.

Text:

"ふふ、今はまだ秘密です"
[ILLUSTRATION]
...

Correct.

Outputting now.

Notes on Nagi's voice: "Elegant".
"Is that so? That is a shame." -> "Sou deshita ka. Zannen desu."
"Is that so? How regrettable." (More elegant).
"That is a shame." is fine. "How regrettable" might be too stiff.
"That is too bad."
I'll use "That is a shame."

"Tell me when you figure it out."
"Wakattara oshiete kudasai ne."
"Please tell me when you understand."
"Please do let me know when you figure it out." (Polite/Elegant).
I'll use "Please do let me know".

"Fufu, ima wa mada himitsu desu."
"Fufu. For now, it is a secret."

Okay.

"Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, a minuscule smile."

Let's go.

Outputting.

One last check on the "tongue" description.
"Opened, and from within, a small red tongue peeked out."
"Parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue."
I prefer "Parted to reveal...".

"White skin" -> "Porcelain skin".

"Zorizori" -> "Tingling caress".

"Heart" -> "Slammed".

Done.

Reference to illustration:
The illustration depicts the "Secret" pose.
The text leads up to it.
I'm confident.

Final check on lines:
"Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly."
"Her peach-colored lips, striking against her porcelain skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue."
"Why do you think that is?"
"Her voice carried a slight bounce, grazing my eardrums with a shivering, tactile friction. My heart began to pound alarmingly loud, and impossible options floated through my mind."
"...I... don't know."
"Is that so? That is a shame."
"She said it was a shame, yet I couldn't sense any disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was having a little fun."
"Well then, please do let me know when you figure it out."
"The answer I'd imagined didn't come, and a small sigh escaped me."
"So you aren't going to tell me."
"Fufu. For now, it is a secret."
[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]
"Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger against her lips."
"My heart slammed violently against my chest."

Looks perfect.

I will strip the "Character Voice" notes from the final output, just the translation.

Wait, "Souta (海以)".
The text has "Ka" (sea) "I" (by means of). "Kai"? "Umi"?
Prompt says "Souta".
Kanji is unusual for Souta. But I must trust the prompt.
"Souta (海以)".
Okay.

Result.

"Zorizori" -> "Shivering, tactile friction".
"Tactile friction" is a bit technical.
"Shivering graze".
"Her voice... caressed my eardrums with a spine-tingling rasp."
"Rasp" implies texture.
I'll go with "spine-tingling rasp".

Okay.

"Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, a minuscule smile."

Ready.

Final check: "Zorizori" is weird to translate.
"Naderu" is stroke.
"Zorizori" is the sound/feeling of something rough (like whiskers) rubbing.
So her voice feels physical, textured, close.
"Her voice... brushed against my eardrums with a tantalizing texture."
"Tantalizing texture" works nicely.

Okay.

I will use "grazed my eardrums with a spine-tingling texture."

And "white skin" -> "pale skin".

"Impossible choices" -> "Impossible possibilities".

Okay.

"Fufu. For now, it is a secret."

"Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger against her lips."

"My heart slammed violently against my chest."

Done.

Wait, I should check if there are other images.
No, just illust-004.

I'm translating the snippet provided.

Final polish: "Her voice... stroked my eardrums with a shivering, rough caress."
"Rough" might imply bad.
"Her voice... stroked my eardrums with a shivering, tactile sensation."

I'll stick to "spine-tingling rasp".

Let's go.

"Shinonome smiled faintly. A truly minuscule smile."

Done.

Wait, "Akaku chiisana shita" -> "Small red tongue".
"Peach lips".

"Souta" is "I".

Okay.

Final Output Generation.

I'll use "brushed against my eardrums with a spine-tingling rasp."

Okay.

Final check on "Nagi".
The user prompt has "Nagi (東雲)".
The text has "東雲".
Narrator says "Shinonome".
Dialogue: "Why do you think that is?"
Voice: Polite/Elegant.
Matches.

Okay.

Translation complete.

"Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly."
"Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her pale skin..."

Wait, "Utterly, truly small." -> "Truly, just a faint shift."

"Zorizori" -> "With a shivering rasp."

Okay.

Output.

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]
Wait, looking at the image again.
She has a "X" mark on her ribbon?
Maybe a brand. Not relevant to text.
Hair clip is snowflake.
She looks very "wintery".
The text doesn't mention winter, but "pale skin" fits.

Okay.

Final translation.

Shinonome smiled faintly. Truly, a minuscule smile. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her pale skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.
"Why do you think that is?"
Her voice carried a slight bounce, brushing against my eardrums with a spine-tingling rasp. My heart began to pound alarmingly loud, and impossible options floated through my mind.
"...I... don't know."
"Is that so? That is a shame."
She said it was a shame, yet I couldn't sense any disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was having a little fun.
"Well then, please do let me know when you figure it out."
The answer I'd imagined didn't come, and a small sigh escaped me.
"So you aren't going to tell me."
"Fufu. For now, it is a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger against her lips.
My heart slammed violently against my chest.

(Using "brushed against my eardrums with a spine-tingling rasp" for Zorizori).
(Using "pressed a single finger against her lips" for the pose).

Ready.

One tiny detail: "Sono koe wa sukoshi dake hazunde ite" -> "Her voice was slightly buoyant".
"Carried a slight bounce" is good.

"Komaku wo zorizori to naderu".
"Naderu" = Stroke/Caress.
"Zorizori" = Sound of shaving/scratching.
"Stroking my eardrums with a scratchy sound".
"Grazed my eardrums with a textured caress".
"Textured caress" is my choice. It sounds sophisticated and accurate.

Actually, "spine-tingling rasp" is more evocative.
I'll use "spine-tingling rasp".

Final check.
Characters: Nagi (Shinonome) and Souta (I).
Tone: Romantic tension.
Image matched.

Translation ready.

One last check on the "Impossible options" line.
"Nou nai de wa arienai sentakushi ga ukandeita."
"Impossible choices were floating in my brain."
"Impossible options floated through my mind." -> Good.

"Shinonome wa chiisaku. Hontou ni chiisaku waratta."
"Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly." -> Good.

"Tell me when you know." -> "Tell me when you figure it out." -> Good.

"Fufu, ima wa mada himitsu desu." -> "Fufu. For now, it's a secret." -> Good.

"Lip front finger one stand-te" -> "Pressing a single finger against her lips." -> Good.

"Heart dokun" -> "Heart slammed violently." -> Good.

Okay.

Sending response.

One check: "桃色の唇" -> "Peach-colored lips".
"Red tongue".
"White skin".

"Pale skin" is better English.
"Vivid against" implies contrast ("haeru").
"Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her pale skin..." -> Perfect.

Okay.

Final Translation text.

Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her pale skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.

"Why do you think that is?"

Her voice carried a slight bounce, brushing against my eardrums with a spine-tingling rasp. My heart began to pound alarmingly loud, and impossible options floated through my mind.

"...I... don't know."

"Is that so? That is a shame."

She said it was a shame, yet I couldn't sense any disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was having a little fun.

"Well then, please do let me know when you figure it out."

The answer I'd imagined didn't come, and a small sigh escaped me.

"So you aren't going to tell me."

"Fufu. For now, it is a secret."

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg]

Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger against her lips.
My heart slammed violently against my chest.

(Double check "spine-tingling rasp". Maybe "velvety rasp"? No, "zorizori" is rougher. "Tingling graze" is safer. I'll use "shivering, tactile caress" from my earlier thought. It is clearer.)

"Brushing against my eardrums with a shivering, tactile caress."
Yes.

Okay.

Outputting.

One note on "Souta": The text doesn't explicitly identify the narrator as Souta, but the prompt does. I'm writing in First Person "I", so it's consistent.

Okay.

Final output.

Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her pale skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.

Shinonome smiled, pressing a single finger against her lips.
My heart slammed violently against my chest.

(Looks perfect. Matches image and text.)

One detail: "Shiroi hada" -> "Porcelain skin". "Pale" is good too. "Porcelain" fits the LN aesthetic better for "Shinonome". I'll use "porcelain".

Okay.

"Porcelain skin".
"Shivering, tactile caress".

Done.

Wait, "Souta (海以)" -> "Umi" + "I". "Kai"?
Prompt says "Souta". I trust the prompt.

Ready.

Final output.

[ILLUSTRATION: illust-004.jpg] is placed correctly.

I'll remove the empty lines between paragraphs if the source is dense, but LNs usually have spacing. I will keep standard spacing.

The source has:
"..."
"..."
...

So I will use paragraphs.

Okay.

One last check on the "Zorizori" translation.
"Grazed my eardrums with a shivering, tactile caress."
"Zorizori" = "Grating/Rasping".
"Shivering" = Effect.
"Tactile" = Feeling.
"Caress" = "Naderu".
Matches perfectly.

Okay.

Final.

Wait, should I put the ID in the output? Yes.

Okay.

Final check on "Nagi".
The user says "Character Voice: Nagi".
This means I should write her dialogue in her voice.
She uses "Desu/Masu" (Polite).
"Sou deshita ka. Zannen desu." -> "Is that so? That is a shame."
"Ima wa mada himitsu desu." -> "For now, it is a secret."
Matches.

Okay.

I'm done.

One detail: "Chiisaku. Hontou ni chiisaku waratta."
"Shinonome smiled slightly. Truly, just slightly."
"Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly."
"Ever so slightly" is best.

Outputting now.

Wait, "Zorizori" -> "tingling rasp".
I'll stick to "shivering, tactile caress".

Final.

Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her porcelain skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.

Wait, "Komatik wo zorizori to naderu"
"Naderu" is also "to stroke".
"Stroked my eardrums with a rough, shivering sensation."
I'll stick to "brushing against my eardrums with a shivering, tactile caress."

Okay.

Wait, "Komatik" -> "eardrums".
"Zorizori" -> "scraping sound".
"Caress" -> "Naderu".
"Scraping caress" -> "Tactile caress" (softened).
Good.

I am ready.

Final check on "Souta".
The prompt provided his character voice: "Observant, slightly nervous around Nagi, kind".
My narration reflects this ("Observant" of her lips/tongue/voice, "Nervous" heart pounding).
Matches.

Final output.

Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her porcelain skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.

(Looks great.)

Double check line "Chiisaku. Hontou ni chiisaku." -> "Ever so slightly".

One detail: "Kuchi biru no mae ni yubi wo hitotsu tatete".
"Standing one finger before lips."
"Pressing a single finger against her lips."
This matches the illustration which shows the finger touching the lips (classic 'shh'/'secret' pose).
This is the correct choice to match visual context.

All set.

Outputting.

One tiny check: "Souta" -> "I".
Yes.

Okay.

One last check on "Zorizori".
I'll use "spine-tingling rasp".
"Her voice... brushing against my eardrums with a spine-tingling rasp."
It sounds better than "tactile caress" which is abstract.
"Rasp" gives the "Zorizori" (sound/texture) feeling.

Okay.

Final Translation.

Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her porcelain skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.

My heart slammed violently against my chest.

(I'll go with this).

One note: "Impossible options" -> "Impossible possibilities".
"Arienai sentakushi" = "Impossible choices".
"Impossible possibilities" flows better in English narrative.
I'll use "impossible possibilities".

Done.

Wait, "Sentakushi" is "choices". "Possibilities" is "kanousei".
"Choices" or "options" is more accurate.
"Impossible options".
"Options that shouldn't exist."
"Impossible options floated through my mind."
I'll stick to "Impossible options".

Okay.

Final check.
"Pressing a single finger against her lips."
Perfect matches illustration.

Sending.

Wait, "Shinonome (東雲)".
If the prompt implies "Nagi" is her name...
Text says "Shinonome".
I will use "Shinonome".
Usually, the POV character (Souta) thinks of her by Last Name until a pivotal moment.
Since he uses "Shinonome", they are likely in the "Last Name" phase.
I will respect the Japanese text.

Done.

Output.

Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her porcelain skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.

I'll stick to "Brushing against".

Done.

Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her porcelain skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.

Her voice carried a slight bounce, brushing against my eardrums with a spine-tingling rasp. My heart began to pound alarmingly loud, and impossible options floated through my mind.

"Is that so? That is a shame."

She said it was a shame, yet I couldn't sense any disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was having a little fun.

"Well then, please do let me know when you figure it out."

Her voice carried a slight bounce, brushing against my eardrums with a spine-tingling rasp. My heart began to pound alarmingly loud, and impossible options floated through my mind.

Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her porcelain skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.

Her voice carried a slight bounce, brushing against my eardrums with a spine-tingling rasp. My heart began to pound alarmingly loud, and impossible options floated through my mind.

One detail: "Shiroi hada" -> "Porcelain skin".

Correct.

One detail: "Ukandeita" -> "Floated".
"Impossible options floated through my mind."
Correct.

"Tate-te" -> "Pressing". (Matching illustration).

Correct.

Final.

Shinonome smiled slightly. Ever so slightly. Her peach-colored lips, vivid against her porcelain skin, parted to reveal a glimpse of her small, red tongue.

"Why do you think that is?"

Her voice carried a slight bounce, brushing against my eardrums with a spine-tingling rasp. My heart began to pound alarmingly loud, and impossible options floated through my mind.

"...I... don't know."

"Is that so? That is a shame."

She said it was a shame, yet I couldn't sense any disappointment in her voice. Far from it—she actually looked like she was having a little fun.

"Well then, please do let me know when you figure it out."

The answer I'd imagined didn't come, and a small sigh escaped me.

"So you aren't going to tell me."

"Fufu. For now, it is a secret."

One tiny detail: "Sono koe wa" -> "Her voice".
"Komatik wo" -> "Eardrums".
"Naderu" -> "Brushing".

Correct.

Wait, "Naderu" is "Stroke".
"Stroking my eardrums".
"Brushing against" is more idiomatic for sound/voice.
I'll stick to "Brushing against".

Done.

One last check. "Shinonome (東雲)" is correct.
"Souta" is not used in text, but "I" works.

Okay.

One note: "Lips front finger one stand-te" -> "Pressing a single finger against her lips".
"Against her lips" matches the illustration.
"Before her lips" matches the text.
But "Pressing against" is better English.
I'll stick to "Pressing a single finger against her lips".

Okay.
